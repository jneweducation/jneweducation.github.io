Jerry was the kind of guy you love to hate. He was always in a good mood and always had something positive to say. When someone would ask him how he was doing, he would reply, "If I were any better, I would be twins!" He was a unique manager because he had several waiters who had followed him around from restaurant to restaurant. The reason the waiters followed Jerry was because of his attitude. He was a natural motivator. If an employee was having a bad day, Jerry was there telling the employee how to look on the positive side of the situation.” (Source: http://examples.yourdictionary.com/narrative-essay-examples.html#eJbghHSKyA7cV5Mm.99)

I can remember my first ascension to a mountain top well. It happened about three years ago, when it was autumn, and the weather in the mountains was gloomy. My friends offered me to travel to the western Carpathian Mountains, and after a short period of hesitation, I accepted their invitation. There was nothing much to do for me at the time, so I thought a change of surrounding would only be of use to me.

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Ferdinand Magellan and his men arrived in Mactan Island on three ships at about 2:00 AM on April 27,1521 He sent another emissary to Rajah Lapulapu with an ultimatum to submit to the authority of King Humabon and the King of Spain. Rajah Lapulapu and his allies laughed at the ultimatum. In response, Magellan and his men boarded three small boats to take them to the beach. It was low tide and the ships could not get closer because of the wide coral reef stretching about 1.5 kilometers wide. The Spanish cannons would not have reached the shore at this distance. The time is likely about 5 AM with the morning sun already shining when Magellan and his men landed on the shore with his men. The battle was short and intense. Pigafetta noted that the fight was a little more than an hour.very likely the battie ended by 7 AM</p><br />

Jerry was the kind of guy you love to hate. He was always in a good mood and always had something positive to say. When someone would ask him how he was doing, he would reply, "If I were any better, I would be twins!" He was a unique manager because he had several waiters who had followed him around from restaurant to restaurant. The reason the waiters followed Jerry was because of his attitude. He was a natural motivator. If an employee was having a bad day, Jerry was there telling the employee how to look on the positive side of the situation.” (Source: http://examples.yourdictionary.com/narrative-essay-examples.html#eJbghHSKyA7cV5Mm.99)

I can remember my first ascension to a mountain top well. It happened about three years ago, when it was autumn, and the weather in the mountains was gloomy. My friends offered me to travel to the western Carpathian Mountains, and after a short period of hesitation, I accepted their invitation. There was nothing much to do for me at the time, so I thought a change of surrounding would only be of use to me.
