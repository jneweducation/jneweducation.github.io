Video games have been blamed for problems ranging from thumb injuries to low test scores. Detactors of the games complain that they are noisy and flashy, that they involve players so completely that other activities are neglected and that they don't offer physical exercise. These critics, however, are overlooking the benefits Video games help us sharpen the skills that are useful in more serious activities. First these noisy, flashy games train us to ignore distractions. We must keep our minds on what we're doing despite the blinking lights and mechanical noises. This ability helps us when we need to work of concentate despite the honking homs, warning sirens, humming refrigerators, and flickering neon signs that form the background of our lives. In this loud and lively age, we need all the practice we can get in blocking out distractions Second, as we play, we learn to concentrate on and deal with a number of different elements. If we don't we lose right away. Once this skill is developed, it is likely to spill over into more important activities, like studying or putting together projects. In other words, video games improve our ability to process information. Finally, video games give us one essential kind of physical exercise: we get practice in coordinating what our eyes see with what our hands do. This form of coordination makes some academic skills, such as copying From the chalkboard or taking notes for reports, much easier. Of course, good handeye coordination is also vital for important mechanical skills, like driving. Playing video games, therefore, is an enjoyable form of self-improvement. It's wiser to spend a few quarters developing concentration and coordination than buying a bubble gum. Prototype Lesson Plan in English, Third Year​</a>

Video games have been blamed for problems ranging from thumb injuries to low test scores. Detactors of the games complain that they are noisy and flashy, that they involve players so completely that other activities are neglected and that they don't offer physical exercise. These critics, however, are overlooking the benefits Video games help us sharpen the skills that are useful in more serious activities. First these noisy, flashy games train us to ignore distractions. We must keep our minds on what we're doing despite the blinking lights and mechanical noises. This ability helps us when we need to work of concentate despite the honking homs, warning sirens, humming refrigerators, and flickering neon signs that form the background of our lives. In this loud and lively age, we need all the practice we can get in blocking out distractions Second, as we play, we learn to concentrate on and deal with a number of different elements. If we don't we lose right away. Once this skill is developed, it is likely to spill over into more important activities, like studying or putting together projects. In other words, video games improve our ability to process information. Finally, video games give us one essential kind of physical exercise: we get practice in coordinating what our eyes see with what our hands do. This form of coordination makes some academic skills, such as copying From the chalkboard or taking notes for reports, much easier. Of course, good handeye coordination is also vital for important mechanical skills, like driving. Playing video games, therefore, is an enjoyable form of self-improvement. It's wiser to spend a few quarters developing concentration and coordination than buying a bubble gum. Prototype Lesson Plan in English, Third Year​</h2><br />
