When the Princess came back, she was shocked to see a snake sitting on her husband's mouth.On a mount nearby sat another snake. They were talking amomg themselves. " Why don't you leave the body of prince? He is so kind and gentle"  said the snake sitting on a mound.  " You too are evil! You attack passers-by. You should not be telling me what to do," replied the snake sitting on the mouth of the Prince.  The princess killed both the snakes with all her courage When her husband woke up, she told him about the two snakes. The King was happy. Then he told her who he really was. They set off to the Prince's palace. The king was delighted to see his son. When the King learned that the devilish snake was killed, his joy knew no bounds.
