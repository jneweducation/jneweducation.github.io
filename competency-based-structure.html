Identify the literary approach being referred to in the following 1. This refers to critical approaches that analyze, interpret or evaluate the inherent leatures of a text. These features include not only grammar and syntax but also literary devices such as meter and figures of speech. 2. It is a type of literary critique that judges the value of literature based on its moral or ethical teachings. 3. This approach in literary criticism is anchored on the political theory. The focus is to describe how social class, economy, money and power play a role in literary selections. The social class strugples in literature reflect how the low class are being dominated by the upper class in the society. The critic will dig into how the dominant groups exploit the minority groups in a text and how to redeem the status of said minority groups. 4. In this approach, the critic will look into how literature treats women such as their roles, images, portrayals, character, and chajacterization. It aims to uplift the women's status from a discriminated or silenced one into women who are equal with men. Its intention is not to overcome the men but both to have harmony and collaboration. 5. This approach in literary criticism perceives that each literary work is a product of its time and its world. It investigates how a tex: manifests the attitudes, beliefs, ideas and culture of the period it was created. In doing this, the reader or critic will look int the background of a story or a poem in order that he or she will understand the text better. Included in the background are the author, the time it was written, and the situation at that time. the following questions based on the poem "The Road Not Taken" by​</a>

2. Past tense - is used for events that happened at a specific time in the past. 
3. Future tense – The forms will + verb (will have, will honor) and be + going to + verb (am going to recite) are used in talking about the future actions. going to recite) are used in talking about the future actions.

The teachers continue to motivate people to take care of the environment. 
⮚ When the subject is plural, the verb has no s or es./ using the base form of the verb.
Past Tense 
He continued working with the group since 2005. 
⮚ d or ed will be added to a regular verb when the action was done already. 
⮚ Changes in spelling may apply for the irregular verbs.
Future Tense 
He will continue to inspire the people of all ages. 
He is going to continue to inspire the people of all ages. 
⮚ The modal will be added to the base form of the verb to express futurity. 
⮚ Going to is preceded by a form of a verb be and followed by the simple form of a verb
⮚ The simple past tense is formed by adding “d or ed” to the verb. Examples: play-played, work-worked, smile-smiled 
⮚ Some verbs are formed by changing the spelling 
Examples: 
Present Tense 
Past Tense

⮚ Some verbs remain unchanged. 
Examples: cut-cut; put-put; hit-hit 
Activity 1: Underline the verb in each sentence. Write present, past, future to tell about the verb tense. 
Example: Cats likes to eat fish. Present

                            19. Simple Aspects of the Verb 
Learning Competency: Compose clear and coherent sentences using appropriate grammatical structures: Aspects of verbs (EN5-Ia-12 and 13 EN5G-Ia/Ib-3.3) 
Concept/Short Input:

The teachers continue to motivate people to take care of the environment. 
⮚ When the subject is plural, the verb has no s or es./ using the base form of the verb.
Past Tense 
He continued working with the group since 2005. 
⮚ d or ed will be added to a regular verb when the action was done already. 
⮚ Changes in spelling may apply for the irregular verbs.
Future Tense 
He will continue to inspire the people of all ages. 
He is going to continue to inspire the people of all ages. 
⮚ The modal will be added to the base form of the verb to express futurity. 
⮚ Going to is preceded by a form of a verb be and followed by the simple form of a verb
⮚ The simple past tense is formed by adding “d or ed” to the verb. Examples: play-played, work-worked, smile-smiled 
⮚ Some verbs are formed by changing the spelling 
Examples: 
Present Tense 
Past Tense

⮚ Some verbs remain unchanged. 
Examples: cut-cut; put-put; hit-hit 
Activity 1: Underline the verb in each sentence. Write present, past, future to tell about the verb tense. 
Example: Cats likes to eat fish. Present
