Margielyn Didal hopes skateboarding reputation changes after Olympics debut
By: Bong Lozada - INQUIRER.net/ 08:23 PM August 04, 2021
MANILA, Philippines-Margielyn Didal's debut in the Olympics may not have produced a
medal but her impact outside of Tokyo was surely felt.
While she became a social media darling in Brazil, her influence in her own country of the
Philippines could be the start of a new sporting revolution.
Didal hopes that skateboarding's debut in the Tokyo Olympics could lead to Filipino
children taking up the sport and the society looking at it in a different light.
"The skate scene in the Philippines is really big already but I can't really tell how big it is
because skateboarding as a sport is kind of new," said Didal in a virtual press conference.
"I've been a skateboarder for nine, 10 years already and it's grown big."

CHOUDTA
"It's already big but I know it'll get bigger because they included skateboarding in the Olympics."
Didal was a trailblazer in the Philippine sporting scene becoming the first Filipino to join the X Games and was a gold medalist in both the
Southeast Asian Games and Asian Games.
Her World Skate ranking eventually put her in the Summer Games and it was on the international stage became a household name outside the
Philippines
The Tokyo Olympics' social media accounts heavily pushed Didal as her antics and overall friendliness attached her to Brazil's sporting
community when she hit it off with women's street silver medalist Rayssa Leal.
Didal further gained attention when her post with Tony Hawk, arguably the greatest skateboarder of all time, went viral.
The Cebu City native hoped that through the Olympic exposure that skateboarding will become more mainstream and not a sport shrouded
under a negative reputation
"I hope that it can be seen better, I want to spread the good vibes," said Didal who finished seventh in the women's street final. "I hope they
saw that here in skateboarding that there is really a big chance to enter the Olympics.

The National Aeronautics and Space Administration is America’s civil space program and the global leader in space exploration. The agency has a diverse workforce of just under 18,000 civil servants, and works with many more U.S. contractors, academia, and international and commercial partners to explore, discover, and expand knowledge for the benefit of humanity. With an annual budget of $23.2 billion in Fiscal Year 2021, which is less than 0.5% of the overall U.S. federal budget, NASA supports more than 312,000 jobs across the United States, generating more than $64.3 billion in total economic output (Fiscal Year 2019). 
At its 20 centers and facilities across the country – and the only National Laboratory in space – NASA studies Earth, including its climate, our Sun, and our solar system and beyond. We conduct research, testing, and development to advance aeronautics, including electric propulsion and supersonic flight. We develop and fund space technologies that will enable future exploration and benefit life on Earth.
NASA also leads a Moon to Mars exploration approach, which includes working with U.S. industry, international partners, and academia to develop new technology, and send science research and soon humans to explore the Moon on Artemis missions that will help prepare for human exploration of the Red Planet. In addition to those major missions, the agency shares what it learns so that its information can make life better for people worldwide. For example, companies use NASA discoveries and technologies to create new products for the public. To ensure future success for the agency and the nation, NASA also supports education efforts in STEM with an emphasis on increasing diversity in our future workforce.

                                            Read the statements below. Write G if the information is general. Write S if is specific.16. The rapid shift away from fossil fuels needed to limit warming poses a multi-trillion dollar risk to investors and resource-rich nations because it could leave infrastructure idle and untapped resources in the ground 17. "About 30% of oil, 50% of gas, and 80% of coal reserves will remain unburnable if warming is limited to 2 degrees C," the report said, adding that the loss of wealth from such "stranded assets" could create risks Tor financial markets. 18. But there are economic opportunities for investors looking to profit from the growing solar, wind, and other dean energy industries and businesses keen to benefit from their falling costs and improved technology. 19. Since the Ukraine invasion began on February 24, the Assembly has adopted two resolutions denouncing Russia with at least 140 yes votes. Moscow says it is carrying out a "special military operation" to destroy Ukraine's military infrastructure. 20. Despite decades of international climate negotiations, carbon emissions and fossil fuel energy demand have been rising steadily, with current emissions projections putting 1.5 degrees C well out of reach. 21. Tight global energy markets and high fuel prices have led big energy consumer nations like the United States to call for increased oil and gas drilling in the near term-reflecting a shift in priorities from tackling climate change to shoring up energy security, 22. A two-thirds majority vote by the 193-member assembly in New York can suspend a state from the council for persistently committing gross and systematic human rights violations.​</a>

From the table of data, the most significant items are as follows. In the first section 81% of the students regularly read academic books" while 44% regularly read academic journals. Nothing else is read regularly or often by 40% or more of the students. The following comments can be made about the reading of newspapers, magazines and fiction. 75% sometimes read regional or local newspapers, 69% sometimes read books of fiction, 62% sometimes read general magazines, and 56% sometimes read national daily newspapers. On the other hand, 37% never read Sunday newspapers and 31% never read fiction. in the second section, not surprisingly, 100% read news about their own country newspapers and 56% read this first. 94% read international news, 25% read this first. 81% read about Britain and look at radio and TV information. T nly other item that is usually read by more than 50% of the students is current aff ead by 56%).

                                            Growing Our Future
There’s some good news as the nation marks Forestry Week starting today and hosts a five-day international gathering to mark the event. Studies conducted by the Food and Agriculture Organization show that the quality of forest management in the Asia-Pacific region has generally improved, resulting in growth in planted and protected forest areas along with an increase in forestry products to meet growing demand.
The Asia-Pacific, which now accounts for 18.1 percent of the global total of forest cover, has seen its forest area increase by five million hectares since 2010 and 20 million since 2000, according to the FAO’s Global Forest Resources Assessment 2015. Production of sawn timber, wood-based panels and other goods from the forest have also gone up significantly, the report noted. In the Philippines, the forest area has expanded by an average rate 
of 240,000 hectares per year, according to the report. 
The positive developments have been attributed to sustainable forestry policies, which take into account the needs of poor communities that live on forest resources. Instead of preventing them from engaging in their marginal livelihood activities, they are turned into stakeholders in sustainable forestry. International cooperation in forest conservation and better enforcement of laws protecting forest resources have also led to positive results.
Problems persist, however, as destructive forestry activities and weak conservation measures continue to deplete forests. In some countries, forests are being cleared through the quick but destructive slash-and-burn method to make way for farms to produce biofuels. The destruction of forests is also depriving animals such as the orangutan of their natural habitats.
Communities understand the need to make their livelihood sources sustainable. Projects promoting reforestation, reduced impact logging, and training in forest fire management have been supported by these communities. They understand this special week’s theme, which likens sustainable forestry to growing our future.
In the Philippines, people have suffered through enough killer typhoons, landslides and floods to understand the importance of maintaining watersheds. There has been laudable progress in efforts to save the forests. Still, much work remains and gains can be reversed if vigilance is not sustained.

Margielyn Didal hopes skateboarding reputation changes after Olympics debut
By: Bong Lozada - INQUIRER.net/ 08:23 PM August 04, 2021
MANILA, Philippines-Margielyn Didal's debut in the Olympics may not have produced a
medal but her impact outside of Tokyo was surely felt.
While she became a social media darling in Brazil, her influence in her own country of the
Philippines could be the start of a new sporting revolution.
Didal hopes that skateboarding's debut in the Tokyo Olympics could lead to Filipino
children taking up the sport and the society looking at it in a different light.
"The skate scene in the Philippines is really big already but I can't really tell how big it is
because skateboarding as a sport is kind of new," said Didal in a virtual press conference.
"I've been a skateboarder for nine, 10 years already and it's grown big."

"It's already big but I know it'll get bigger because they included skateboarding in the Olympics."
Didal was a trailblazer in the Philippine sporting scene becoming the first Filipino to join the X Games and was a gold medalist in both the
Southeast Asian Games and Asian Games.
Her World Skate ranking eventually put her in the Summer Games and it was on the international stage became a household name outside the
Philippines
The Tokyo Olympics' social media accounts heavily pushed Didal as her antics and overall friendliness attached her to Brazil's sporting
community when she hit it off with women's street silver medalist Rayssa Leal.
Didal further gained attention when her post with Tony Hawk, arguably the greatest skateboarder of all time, went viral.
The Cebu City native hoped that through the Olympic exposure that skateboarding will become more mainstream and not a sport shrouded
under a negative reputation
"I hope that it can be seen better, I want to spread the good vibes," said Didal who finished seventh in the women's street final. "I hope they
saw that here in skateboarding that there is really a big chance to enter the Olympics.

                            9. Read the statements below. Write G if the information is general. Write S if is specific.16. The rapid shift away from fossil fuels needed to limit warming poses a multi-trillion dollar risk to investors and resource-rich nations because it could leave infrastructure idle and untapped resources in the ground 17. "About 30% of oil, 50% of gas, and 80% of coal reserves will remain unburnable if warming is limited to 2 degrees C," the report said, adding that the loss of wealth from such "stranded assets" could create risks Tor financial markets. 18. But there are economic opportunities for investors looking to profit from the growing solar, wind, and other dean energy industries and businesses keen to benefit from their falling costs and improved technology. 19. Since the Ukraine invasion began on February 24, the Assembly has adopted two resolutions denouncing Russia with at least 140 yes votes. Moscow says it is carrying out a "special military operation" to destroy Ukraine's military infrastructure. 20. Despite decades of international climate negotiations, carbon emissions and fossil fuel energy demand have been rising steadily, with current emissions projections putting 1.5 degrees C well out of reach. 21. Tight global energy markets and high fuel prices have led big energy consumer nations like the United States to call for increased oil and gas drilling in the near term-reflecting a shift in priorities from tackling climate change to shoring up energy security, 22. A two-thirds majority vote by the 193-member assembly in New York can suspend a state from the council for persistently committing gross and systematic human rights violations.​</h2><br />

Although her exam scores were not as high as she had hoped, her consistently strong performance on writing assignments tipped her grade from a B+ to an A−. She was pleased to have earned a high grade in one of the required courses for her major. She was also glad to have gotten the most out of an introductory course that would help her become an effective teacher.

</p><p>To do well in the post-secondary environment, it is important to stay focused on how your day-to-day actions determine your long-term success. You may not have defined your career goals or chosen a major yet. Even so, you surely have some overarching goals for what you want out of your studies to expand your career options, to increase your earning power, or just to learn something new.

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>The nonprofit Center for Audit Quality explains auditor independence: “Auditors’ independence from company management is essential for a successful audit because it enables them to approach the audit with the necessary professional skepticism.”1 The center goes on to identify a key practice to protect independence by which an external auditor reports not to a company’s management, which could make it more difficult to maintain independence, but to a company’s audit committee. The audit committee oversees the auditors’ work and monitors disagreements between management and the auditor about financial reporting. Internal auditors of a company are not the auditors that provide an opinion on the financial statements of a company. According to the Center for Audit Quality, “By law, public companies’ annual financial statements are audited each year by independent auditors—accountants who examine the data for conformity with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP).”2 The opinion from the independent auditors regarding a publicly traded company is filed for public inspection, along with the financial statements of the publicly traded company.</p><br />

                            28. Growing Our Future
There’s some good news as the nation marks Forestry Week starting today and hosts a five-day international gathering to mark the event. Studies conducted by the Food and Agriculture Organization show that the quality of forest management in the Asia-Pacific region has generally improved, resulting in growth in planted and protected forest areas along with an increase in forestry products to meet growing demand.
The Asia-Pacific, which now accounts for 18.1 percent of the global total of forest cover, has seen its forest area increase by five million hectares since 2010 and 20 million since 2000, according to the FAO’s Global Forest Resources Assessment 2015. Production of sawn timber, wood-based panels and other goods from the forest have also gone up significantly, the report noted. In the Philippines, the forest area has expanded by an average rate 
of 240,000 hectares per year, according to the report. 
The positive developments have been attributed to sustainable forestry policies, which take into account the needs of poor communities that live on forest resources. Instead of preventing them from engaging in their marginal livelihood activities, they are turned into stakeholders in sustainable forestry. International cooperation in forest conservation and better enforcement of laws protecting forest resources have also led to positive results.
Problems persist, however, as destructive forestry activities and weak conservation measures continue to deplete forests. In some countries, forests are being cleared through the quick but destructive slash-and-burn method to make way for farms to produce biofuels. The destruction of forests is also depriving animals such as the orangutan of their natural habitats.
Communities understand the need to make their livelihood sources sustainable. Projects promoting reforestation, reduced impact logging, and training in forest fire management have been supported by these communities. They understand this special week’s theme, which likens sustainable forestry to growing our future.
In the Philippines, people have suffered through enough killer typhoons, landslides and floods to understand the importance of maintaining watersheds. There has been laudable progress in efforts to save the forests. Still, much work remains and gains can be reversed if vigilance is not sustained.

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>slayed slay slay slay slay slay slay slay</p><p></p><p>The situation described appears to be a case of poor accounting practices at Prospere General Merchandise. Here is my analysis and justification of each point:</p><p></p>The fact that the financial reports are based on SFAS promulgated by the ASC is a positive sign, as it indicates that the company is following generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP).Reporting assets and owner's equity at fair value but business obligations at historical cost is not necessarily a problem, as this is a common practice in accounting. However, it may be worth examining the company's specific reasoning for this choice.The fact that the company has only one employee serving as accountant, internal auditor, collector, and treasurer is a red flag. It is highly unlikely that this individual has the necessary skills and expertise to perform all of these roles effectively, which could lead to errors, fraud, or other issues.The consistent delay of financial reports suggests that the company lacks a proper accounting system or process. This could indicate a lack of organization, resources, or commitment to financial transparency.Reporting estimated future earnings in the current financial reports is not acceptable under GAAP, as financial statements are meant to reflect past performance and current conditions, not future projections.Changing accounting methods and procedures regularly can create confusion and inconsistency in financial reporting, which can make it difficult for stakeholders to understand the company's performance and financial position.Recording transactions without proper supporting documents is a serious breach of accounting ethics and can lead to inaccurate financial reporting.While minutes of meetings, business contracts, and future plans may not be financial in nature, they can provide important context and insight into the company's operations and performance.Refusing to be audited by an external auditor is a red flag, as it suggests a lack of transparency and accountability. While having an internal auditor is important, an external audit provides an objective and independent review of the company's financial reporting.Depreciating a refillable pen over five years is not a material error, but it is an indication that the company may not have a clear understanding of accounting principles and the concept of materiality.<br />
