                                            27-30. Give 4 benefits in planting trees or fruit-bearing trees​Social BenefitsTrees make life nicer. It has been shown that spending time among trees and green spaces reduces the amount of stress that we carry around with us in our daily lives.Hospital patients have been shown to recover from surgery more quickly when their hospital room offered a view of trees.Children have been shown to retain more of the information taught in schools if they spend some of their time outdoors in green spaces.Trees are often planted as living memorials or reminders of loved ones or to commemorate significant events in our lives.Communal BenefitsEven though you may own the trees on your property your neighbors may benefit from them as well.Through careful planning trees can be an asset to your entire community.Tree lined streets have a traffic calming effect, traffic moves more slowly and safely.Trees can be placed to screen unwanted views or noise from busy highways.Trees can complement the architecture or design of buildings or entire neighborhoods.Environmental BenefitsTrees offer many environmental benefits.Trees reduce the urban heat island effect through evaporative cooling and reducing the amount of sunlight that reaches parking lots and buildings. This is especially true in areas with large impervious surfaces, such as parking lots of stores and industrial complexes.Trees improve our air quality by filtering harmful dust and pollutants such as ozone, carbon monoxide, and sulfur dioxide from the air we breathe.Trees give off oxygen that we need to breathe.Trees reduce the amount of storm water runoff, which reduces erosion and pollution in our waterways and may reduce the effects of flooding.Many species of wildlife depend on trees for habitat. Trees provide food, protection, and homes for many birds and mammals.Economic BenefitsWell placed trees can reduce your cooling costs in the summer by shading the south and west sides of your home. If deciduous trees are used they will allow the sun to pass through and warm your home in the winter.Evergreen trees on the north side of your home and shrubs around the foundation of your home can act as a windbreak to reduce the cooling effects of winter winds.The value of a well landscaped home with mature healthy trees can be as much as 10% higher than a similar home with no or little landscaping. (Topping will reduce the value of your trees)Some indirect economic benefits of trees are that if we reduce the energy we use then utility companies will have less demand placed on the infrastructure, thus reducing operating costs which can be passed on to the consumer.</a>

They have a lot of energy. You need to play with them oftenKittens will chew on almost anything they find. You have to watch them closely.12. Before clocks were made, people kept track of time by other means. In ancient Egypt, people used a water clock Water drippedslowly from one clay pot into another. People measured time according to how long it took one pot to empty and the other one tofill. Candle clocks were common during the Middle Ages. As such, when a candle burned, marks on its side showed about howmuch time had passed. A final ancient way to measure time was the sundial, which used the movement of the sun across the skyThe shadows moving across the face of the sundial showed the current time13. There are great numbers of deer around here. This whole area is great place for hunters and fishermen There are bears,mountain lions, and coyotes. To the east there are streams full of trout, and there are ducks and geese14. Advertising affects our lives every day. Brand names are common household words. We start each day using the toothpastesoap, and breakfast foods promoted by advertisers. Ads have made the cars we drive signs of our success Our choices of food,dress, and entertainment are swayed by ads.15. The physical environment of a classroom is extremely important. It can influence the way teachers and students feel, thmk, andbehave. If a student feels pressured, under stress, unhappy, or unsafe, it would be impossible for her or him to learn the lessonsplanned by the educator. Likewise, if a teacher feels unhappy or disorganized because of the classroom's lack of order or detail, theability for her to teach is greatly diminished.16. Apples can be used to make many delicious treats. Some people like to slice apples and dip them in caramel. Others like to cookthem and make them into apple jam. You might enjoy cutting apples and bake them into a pie or maybe you like to use freshlypicked apples to make fresh apple juice. Many people like to just pick apple and eat it right away.17. Chameleons change color for different reasons. They may change color to help their bodies adjust to changes in temperature oflight. They may also change colors depending on certain moods such as fear or excitement.18. Some kinds of bats eat many insects. Some bats can eat up to 600 mosquitoes in one hour. Bats are helpful to the environmentWithout bats, we would have too many insects.19 Sloths are the slowest mammals on earth. It takes a full minute for a sloth to move 6 feet across the ground You probablycouldn't move that slowly if you tried! The sloth's body is about 2 feet long. It has long legs, and curved claws that are 3 to 4 incheslong. Their claws and their long legs help them climb trees and hang from tree branches. They spend almost their entire liveshanging from tree branches.20. Exercise is crucial to our lives. Doctors recommend we exercise at least two times a week. Exercise does not necessarily need tobe done in the gym; it can consist of an outdoor walk or bike ride. It not only controls weight, but it combats many health conditionsand diseases.

NASA’s new rover Perseverance launches for Mars to seek signs of past life Published by Joey Roulette on July 30, 2020 NASA's next-generation Mars rover Perseverance blasted off from Florida's Cape Canaveral on Thursday atop an Atlas 5 rocket on a $2.4-billion mission to search for traces of potential past life on Earth's planetary neighbor. The next-generation robotic rover—a car-sized six-wheeled scientific vehicle—also is scheduled to deploy a mini helicopter on Mars and test out equipment for future human missions to the fourth planet from the sun. It is expected to reach Mars next February. It soared into the sky under clear, sunny and warm conditions carried by an Atlas 5 rocket from the Boeing-Lockheed joint venture United Launch Alliance. The launch took place after the Jet Propulsion Laboratory in California where its mission engineers were located was rattled by an earthquake. This marked NASA's ninth journey to the Martian surface. Perseverance is due to land at the base of an 820-foot-deep (250 meters) crater called Jezero, a former lake from 3.5 billion years ago that scientists suspect could bear evidence of potential past microbial life on Mars. Scientists have long debated whether Mars—once a much more hospitable place than it is today—ever harbored life. Water is considered a key ingredient for life, and Mars billions of years ago had lots of it on the surface before the planet became a harsh and desolate outpost. One of the most complex maneuvers in Perseverance's journey will be what mission engineers call the "seven minutes of terror," when the robot endures extreme heat and speeds during its descent through the Martian atmosphere, deploying a set of supersonic parachutes before igniting mini rocket engines to gently touch down on the planet's surface. This was scheduled as the third launch from Earth to Mars during a busy month of July, following probes sent by the United Arab Emirates and China. The state from which the rover was launched, Florida, is currently one of the hot spots in the United States for the coronavirus pandemic. Aboard Perseverance is a four-pound (1.8 kg) autonomous helicopter named Ingenuity that is due to test powered flight on Mars for the first time. Since NASA's first Mars rover Sojourner landed in 1997, the agency has sent two others—Spirit and Opportunity—that have explored the geology of expansive Martian plains and detected signs of past water formations, among other discoveries. NASA also has successfully sent three landers: Pathfinder, Phoenix, InSight. The United States has plans to send astronauts to Mars in the 2030s under a program that envisions using a return to the moon as a testing platform for human missions before making the more ambitious crewed journey to Mars. Perseverance will conduct an experiment to convert elements of the carbon dioxide-rich Martian atmosphere into propellant for future rockets launching off the planet's surface, or to produce breathable oxygen for future astronauts. The rover also is intended to help bring Martian rock samples back to Earth, collecting materials in cigar-sized capsules and leaving them in various spots on the surface for retrieval by a future "fetch" rover. That planned rover is expected to launch the samples back into space to link up with other spacecraft for an eventual Earth homecoming around 2031. —

                                            Read the text below and identify at least five statements that are opinions or suggestions. / 10 A newborn baby can see, hear and feel. By the age of five, a child can talk, ride a bike and invent imaginary friends. How does this development happen? We don’t understand the way language, thinking and planning develop very well. Now scientists are using new technology to ‘see’ into children’s brains. And they seem to be discovering new information about the way a baby’s brain develops.A study in 2010 showed that the experiences a child has in their first few years affects the development of the brain. It showed that children who received more attention seemed to have higher IQs. The brain of a newborn baby has nearly a hundred billion neurons. This is the same number as an adult’s brain. As they grow, a baby receives information through the senses of sight, hearing, smell, taste and touch. This information creates connections between different parts of the brain. At the age of three, there are a hundred trillion connections.One experiment looked at images of babies’ brains while they were listening to different sounds. The sounds were in different sequences. For example, one sequence was mu-ba-ba. This is the pattern ‘A-B-B’. Another sequence was mu-ba-ge. This is the pattern ‘A-B-C’. The images showed that the part of the brain responsible for speech seemed more active during ‘A-B-B’ patterns. This probably shows that babies can tell the difference between different patterns. This experiment is interesting because sequences of words are important to grammar and meaning. Compare two sentences with the same words in a different order: ‘John killed the bear’ is very different from ‘The bear killed John.’ So, it looks like that babies learn grammatical rules from the beginning of life.Researchers also know that babies need to hear a lot of language in order to understand grammar rules. But there is a big difference between listening to television, audio books or the internet, and interacting with people. One study compared two groups of nine-month-old American babies. One group watched videos of Mandarin Chinese sounds. In the other group, people spoke the same sounds to the babies. The test results showed that it is possible that the second group could recognize different sounds, however the first group learned nothing. The scientist, Patricia Kuhl, said this result was very surprising. It suggests that social experience is essential to successful brain development in babies. ​</a>

                            5. 27-30. Give 4 benefits in planting trees or fruit-bearing trees​Social BenefitsTrees make life nicer. It has been shown that spending time among trees and green spaces reduces the amount of stress that we carry around with us in our daily lives.Hospital patients have been shown to recover from surgery more quickly when their hospital room offered a view of trees.Children have been shown to retain more of the information taught in schools if they spend some of their time outdoors in green spaces.Trees are often planted as living memorials or reminders of loved ones or to commemorate significant events in our lives.Communal BenefitsEven though you may own the trees on your property your neighbors may benefit from them as well.Through careful planning trees can be an asset to your entire community.Tree lined streets have a traffic calming effect, traffic moves more slowly and safely.Trees can be placed to screen unwanted views or noise from busy highways.Trees can complement the architecture or design of buildings or entire neighborhoods.Environmental BenefitsTrees offer many environmental benefits.Trees reduce the urban heat island effect through evaporative cooling and reducing the amount of sunlight that reaches parking lots and buildings. This is especially true in areas with large impervious surfaces, such as parking lots of stores and industrial complexes.Trees improve our air quality by filtering harmful dust and pollutants such as ozone, carbon monoxide, and sulfur dioxide from the air we breathe.Trees give off oxygen that we need to breathe.Trees reduce the amount of storm water runoff, which reduces erosion and pollution in our waterways and may reduce the effects of flooding.Many species of wildlife depend on trees for habitat. Trees provide food, protection, and homes for many birds and mammals.Economic BenefitsWell placed trees can reduce your cooling costs in the summer by shading the south and west sides of your home. If deciduous trees are used they will allow the sun to pass through and warm your home in the winter.Evergreen trees on the north side of your home and shrubs around the foundation of your home can act as a windbreak to reduce the cooling effects of winter winds.The value of a well landscaped home with mature healthy trees can be as much as 10% higher than a similar home with no or little landscaping. (Topping will reduce the value of your trees)Some indirect economic benefits of trees are that if we reduce the energy we use then utility companies will have less demand placed on the infrastructure, thus reducing operating costs which can be passed on to the consumer.</h2><br />

In ancient Egypt, people used a water clock Water drippedslowly from one clay pot into another. People measured time according to how long it took one pot to empty and the other one tofill. Candle clocks were common during the Middle Ages. As such, when a candle burned, marks on its side showed about howmuch time had passed. A final ancient way to measure time was the sundial, which used the movement of the sun across the skyThe shadows moving across the face of the sundial showed the current time13. There are great numbers of deer around here. This whole area is great place for hunters and fishermen There are bears,mountain lions, and coyotes.

Ads have made the cars we drive signs of our success Our choices of food,dress, and entertainment are swayed by ads.15. The physical environment of a classroom is extremely important. It can influence the way teachers and students feel, thmk, andbehave. If a student feels pressured, under stress, unhappy, or unsafe, it would be impossible for her or him to learn the lessonsplanned by the educator. Likewise, if a teacher feels unhappy or disorganized because of the classroom's lack of order or detail, theability for her to teach is greatly diminished.16. Apples can be used to make many delicious treats. Some people like to slice apples and dip them in caramel. Others like to cookthem and make them into apple jam. You might enjoy cutting apples and bake them into a pie or maybe you like to use freshlypicked apples to make fresh apple juice. Many people like to just pick apple and eat it right away.17. Chameleons change color for different reasons. They may change color to help their bodies adjust to changes in temperature oflight. They may also change colors depending on certain moods such as fear or excitement.18. Some kinds of bats eat many insects. Some bats can eat up to 600 mosquitoes in one hour. Bats are helpful to the environmentWithout bats, we would have too many insects.19 Sloths are the slowest mammals on earth. It takes a full minute for a sloth to move 6 feet across the ground You probablycouldn't move that slowly if you tried! The sloth's body is about 2 feet long. It has long legs, and curved claws that are 3 to 4 incheslong. Their claws and their long legs help them climb trees and hang from tree branches. They spend almost their entire liveshanging from tree branches.20. Exercise is crucial to our lives. Doctors recommend we exercise at least two times a week. Exercise does not necessarily need tobe done in the gym; it can consist of an outdoor walk or bike ride. It not only controls weight, but it combats many health conditionsand diseases. Another added benefit to exercise is its mood boosting qualities.​</h2><br />

NASA’s new rover Perseverance launches for Mars to seek signs of past life Published by Joey Roulette on July 30, 2020 NASA's next-generation Mars rover Perseverance blasted off from Florida's Cape Canaveral on Thursday atop an Atlas 5 rocket on a $2.4-billion mission to search for traces of potential past life on Earth's planetary neighbor. The next-generation robotic rover—a car-sized six-wheeled scientific vehicle—also is scheduled to deploy a mini helicopter on Mars and test out equipment for future human missions to the fourth planet from the sun. It is expected to reach Mars next February. It soared into the sky under clear, sunny and warm conditions carried by an Atlas 5 rocket from the Boeing-Lockheed joint venture United Launch Alliance. The launch took place after the Jet Propulsion Laboratory in California where its mission engineers were located was rattled by an earthquake. This marked NASA's ninth journey to the Martian surface. Perseverance is due to land at the base of an 820-foot-deep (250 meters) crater called Jezero, a former lake from 3.5 billion years ago that scientists suspect could bear evidence of potential past microbial life on Mars. Scientists have long debated whether Mars—once a much more hospitable place than it is today—ever harbored life. Water is considered a key ingredient for life, and Mars billions of years ago had lots of it on the surface before the planet became a harsh and desolate outpost. One of the most complex maneuvers in Perseverance's journey will be what mission engineers call the "seven minutes of terror," when the robot endures extreme heat and speeds during its descent through the Martian atmosphere, deploying a set of supersonic parachutes before igniting mini rocket engines to gently touch down on the planet's surface. This was scheduled as the third launch from Earth to Mars during a busy month of July, following probes sent by the United Arab Emirates and China. The state from which the rover was launched, Florida, is currently one of the hot spots in the United States for the coronavirus pandemic. Aboard Perseverance is a four-pound (1.8 kg) autonomous helicopter named Ingenuity that is due to test powered flight on Mars for the first time. Since NASA's first Mars rover Sojourner landed in 1997, the agency has sent two others—Spirit and Opportunity—that have explored the geology of expansive Martian plains and detected signs of past water formations, among other discoveries. NASA also has successfully sent three landers: Pathfinder, Phoenix, InSight. The United States has plans to send astronauts to Mars in the 2030s under a program that envisions using a return to the moon as a testing platform for human missions before making the more ambitious crewed journey to Mars. Perseverance will conduct an experiment to convert elements of the carbon dioxide-rich Martian atmosphere into propellant for future rockets launching off the planet's surface, or to produce breathable oxygen for future astronauts. The rover also is intended to help bring Martian rock samples back to Earth, collecting materials in cigar-sized capsules and leaving them in various spots on the surface for retrieval by a future "fetch" rover. That planned rover is expected to launch the samples back into space to link up with other spacecraft for an eventual Earth homecoming around 2031. —

                            10. Read the text below and identify at least five statements that are opinions or suggestions. / 10 A newborn baby can see, hear and feel. By the age of five, a child can talk, ride a bike and invent imaginary friends. How does this development happen? We don’t understand the way language, thinking and planning develop very well. Now scientists are using new technology to ‘see’ into children’s brains. And they seem to be discovering new information about the way a baby’s brain develops.A study in 2010 showed that the experiences a child has in their first few years affects the development of the brain. It showed that children who received more attention seemed to have higher IQs. The brain of a newborn baby has nearly a hundred billion neurons. This is the same number as an adult’s brain. As they grow, a baby receives information through the senses of sight, hearing, smell, taste and touch. This information creates connections between different parts of the brain. At the age of three, there are a hundred trillion connections.One experiment looked at images of babies’ brains while they were listening to different sounds. The sounds were in different sequences. For example, one sequence was mu-ba-ba. This is the pattern ‘A-B-B’. Another sequence was mu-ba-ge. This is the pattern ‘A-B-C’. The images showed that the part of the brain responsible for speech seemed more active during ‘A-B-B’ patterns. This probably shows that babies can tell the difference between different patterns. This experiment is interesting because sequences of words are important to grammar and meaning. Compare two sentences with the same words in a different order: ‘John killed the bear’ is very different from ‘The bear killed John.’ So, it looks like that babies learn grammatical rules from the beginning of life.Researchers also know that babies need to hear a lot of language in order to understand grammar rules. But there is a big difference between listening to television, audio books or the internet, and interacting with people. One study compared two groups of nine-month-old American babies. One group watched videos of Mandarin Chinese sounds. In the other group, people spoke the same sounds to the babies. The test results showed that it is possible that the second group could recognize different sounds, however the first group learned nothing. The scientist, Patricia Kuhl, said this result was very surprising. It suggests that social experience is essential to successful brain development in babies. ​</h2><br />
