                                            Love Is All We NeedThe world will be a better place if there is love. V.B. Feliciano said "Love is the most powerful thing in the world. It can change you, your world, and your life." Love can make you the happiest person and it teaches you how to be someone. Love is the least understood part of human life. Some people think that love is complicated because it breaks your heart. However, I believe that love is all we need because it encourages us to be the greatest, it makes our life better, and it teaches us to be stronger and more optimistic.I can relate the quote to a movie entitled "A Walk to Remember" where the power of love prevailed between Landon and Jaime. From a bad boy in high school, Landon became a good man for Jaime even if it meant he have to leave his friends. Jaime's love taught Landon so many things by granting some of Jaime's wishes. Even if he knew that Jaime will be gone due to sickness, he cared and loved her all through out.I personally believe in the power of love for so many reasons. First of all, love encourages us to be the greatest. People are influenced by the person they spend the most time with. Being with their loved ones makes them feel special. Because of this, it inspires and motivates them to be the best they can be. Secondly. love makes our life better. It adds color to our life. It makes us the happiest person on earth, Finally, love teaches us to be stronger and more optimistic. Love gives you hope when you're down. It gives you light when all you can see is darkness.In conclusion, love is we need because it gives your life a meaning. It teaches you a lot of lessons that can help you in your life. Love can change you and your life to a better one. Sometimes, it may seem complicated but always remember that giving up is not an option. Love gives you a positive attitude and it makes you the best version of yourself. You could always give without loving, but you can never love without giving.Question :1. what does the thesis statement of the author? 2.

                                            The Gift by Rabindranath Tagore ￼ Next    O my love, what gift of mine Shall I give you this dawn? A morning song? But morning does not last long— The heat of the sun Wilts like a flower And songs that tire Are done. O friend, when you come to my gate. At dusk What is it you ask? What shall I bring you? A light? A lamp from a secret corner of my silent house? But will you want to take it with you Down the crowded street? Alas, The wind will blow it out. Whatever gifts are in my power to give you, Be they flowers, Be they gems for your neck How can they please you If in time they must surely wither, Crack, Lose lustre? All that my hands can place in yours Will slip through your fingers And fall forgotten to the dust To turn into dust. Rather, When you have leisure, Wander idly through my garden in spring And let an unknown, hidden flower’s scent startle you Into sudden wondering— Let that displaced moment Be my gift. Or if, as you peer your way down a shady avenue, Suddenly, spilled From the thick gathered tresses of evening A single shivering fleck of sunset-light stops you, Turns your daydreams to gold, Let that light be an innocent Gift. Truest treasure is fleeting; It sparkles for a moment, then goes. It does not tell its name; its tune Stops us in our tracks, its dance disappears At the toss of an anklet I know no way to it— No hand, nor word can reach it. Friend, whatever you take of it, On your own, Without asking, without knowing, let that Be yours. Anything I can give you is trifling— Be it a flower, or a song. 1.What gifts are in the speaker’s power to give a loved one? 2.Why is the speaker not giving any of these gifts? 3.What gifts does the speaker consider more precious? Why? 4.What do the “scent of the flower” and fleck sunset-light” symbolize? 5.What message does the poem convey in the last two lines? 6. Read the poem and write an analysis paper after. ​</a>

handicap even for a single day. It was then I realized the importance of
family. None of my friends was here to support me. I can’t imagine what
would have happened to me if I was alone. I apologize to my parents for
lying. My mother kissed me in the forehead and said, "It’s okay, I know
you have learnt your lesson." I thank God for giving me such a loving
family. I love my family so much that I can’t live without them.

                                            Tagalog of Remember you don't choose,love chooses you.All you can really do is accept it for all its mystery when it comes into your life.Feel the way if fills you to overflowing.Then reach out and give it away.Give it back to the person who brought it to you.Give it to others who are poor in spirit.Give it to the world around you in any way you can.This is where many lovers go wrong.Having been so long without love,they understand love only as a need.they see their hearts as empty places that will be filled by love,and they begin to look as something,that flows them rather than for them.The first blush of love is filled to overflowing,but as their love cools,they revert to seeing,their love as need.They cease to be someone who generates love and instead become someone who seeks love.They forget that the secret of loveis,that it is a gift,that it can be made to grow only by giving it away.</a>

Life without a car is hard, especially when you live in the Philippines. The chaos that people
I have to go through just to go work and get home using public transportation is such a
hassle. It is very time consuming, so instead of enjoying the hours left in a day with your
family, you spend them jostling with other commuters and struggling to find a ride instead.
But owning a car has its own pros and cons.
On the positive side, having a car gives you more time to do what you want, like go on trips
with your friends and carpool with your officemates. You can also travel to and from work
in comfort.
As for the negative, not everyone can afford to buy a car with cold, hard cash, meaning, you
have to pay for the car in monthly installments on top of your usual bills. You also have to
consider the fuel costs, car maintenance costs, and toll fees. As for me? I think a bit more
expense is worth it if it means I get to spend more time with my loved ones and do the
things I love.</a>

                            4. Love Is All We NeedThe world will be a better place if there is love. V.B. Feliciano said "Love is the most powerful thing in the world. It can change you, your world, and your life." Love can make you the happiest person and it teaches you how to be someone. Love is the least understood part of human life. Some people think that love is complicated because it breaks your heart. However, I believe that love is all we need because it encourages us to be the greatest, it makes our life better, and it teaches us to be stronger and more optimistic.I can relate the quote to a movie entitled "A Walk to Remember" where the power of love prevailed between Landon and Jaime. From a bad boy in high school, Landon became a good man for Jaime even if it meant he have to leave his friends. Jaime's love taught Landon so many things by granting some of Jaime's wishes. Even if he knew that Jaime will be gone due to sickness, he cared and loved her all through out.I personally believe in the power of love for so many reasons. First of all, love encourages us to be the greatest. People are influenced by the person they spend the most time with. Being with their loved ones makes them feel special. Because of this, it inspires and motivates them to be the best they can be. Secondly. love makes our life better. It adds color to our life. It makes us the happiest person on earth, Finally, love teaches us to be stronger and more optimistic. Love gives you hope when you're down. It gives you light when all you can see is darkness.In conclusion, love is we need because it gives your life a meaning. It teaches you a lot of lessons that can help you in your life. Love can change you and your life to a better one. Sometimes, it may seem complicated but always remember that giving up is not an option. Love gives you a positive attitude and it makes you the best version of yourself. You could always give without loving, but you can never love without giving.Question :1. what does the thesis statement of the author? 2.

                            5. The Gift by Rabindranath Tagore ￼ Next    O my love, what gift of mine Shall I give you this dawn? A morning song? But morning does not last long— The heat of the sun Wilts like a flower And songs that tire Are done. O friend, when you come to my gate. At dusk What is it you ask? What shall I bring you? A light? A lamp from a secret corner of my silent house? But will you want to take it with you Down the crowded street? Alas, The wind will blow it out. Whatever gifts are in my power to give you, Be they flowers, Be they gems for your neck How can they please you If in time they must surely wither, Crack, Lose lustre? All that my hands can place in yours Will slip through your fingers And fall forgotten to the dust To turn into dust. Rather, When you have leisure, Wander idly through my garden in spring And let an unknown, hidden flower’s scent startle you Into sudden wondering— Let that displaced moment Be my gift. Or if, as you peer your way down a shady avenue, Suddenly, spilled From the thick gathered tresses of evening A single shivering fleck of sunset-light stops you, Turns your daydreams to gold, Let that light be an innocent Gift. Truest treasure is fleeting; It sparkles for a moment, then goes. It does not tell its name; its tune Stops us in our tracks, its dance disappears At the toss of an anklet I know no way to it— No hand, nor word can reach it. Friend, whatever you take of it, On your own, Without asking, without knowing, let that Be yours. Anything I can give you is trifling— Be it a flower, or a song. 1.What gifts are in the speaker’s power to give a loved one? 2.Why is the speaker not giving any of these gifts? 3.What gifts does the speaker consider more precious? Why? 4.What do the “scent of the flower” and fleck sunset-light” symbolize? 5.What message does the poem convey in the last two lines? 6. Read the poem and write an analysis paper after. ​</h2><br />

lying. My mother kissed me in the forehead and said, "It’s okay, I know
you have learnt your lesson." I thank God for giving me such a loving
family. I love my family so much that I can’t live without them.

                        Tandaan na hindi mo pipiliin, pinipili ka ng pag-ibig. Lahat na maaari mong gawin ay tanggapin ito para sa lahat ng misteryo nito pagdating sa iyong buhay. Huwag mag-alala kung pinupuno ka sa pag-apaw. Pagkatapos ay umabot ka at ibalik ito. Ibigay ito pabalik sa taong nagdala nito sa iyo. Ibigay mo ito sa iba na mahihirap sa espiritu. Ibigay mo ito sa mundo sa paligid mo sa anumang paraan na maaari mong. Ito ay kung saan maraming mga nagmamahal ay nagkamali. Matagal na walang pagmamahal, nauunawaan nila ang pag-ibig tanging bilang isang pangangailangan. Nakita niya ang kanilang mga puso bilang walang laman na mga lugar na mapupuno ng pagmamahal, at nagsisimula silang magmukhang isang bagay, na dumadaloy sa kanila sa halip na para sa kanila. Ang unang pamumula ng pagmamahal ay napuno sa pag-aapoy, ngunit habang ang kanilang pag-ibig ay cools , nagbabalik sila sa pagtingin, ang kanilang pag-ibig bilang pangangailangan. Tiyak na maging isang taong gumagawa ng pag-ibig at sa halip ay maging isang taong naghahanap ng pag-ibig. Nakalimutan nila na ang lihim ng loveis, na ito ay isang regalo, na maaari itong gawin upang lumago lamang sa pamamagitan ng pagbibigay nito.<br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>tendon, tissue that attaches a muscle to other body parts, usually bones. Tendons are the connective tissues that transmit the mechanical force of muscle contraction to the bones; the tendon is firmly connected to muscle fibres at one end and to components of the bone at its other end. Tendons are remarkably strong, having one of the highest tensile strengths found among soft tissues. Their great strength, which is necessary for withstanding the stresses generated by muscular contraction, is attributed to the hierarchical structure, parallel orientation, and tissue composition of tendon fibres.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>I hope it help:)</p><p>pabrainliest na rin po if okay lang sayo;)</p><p></p><br />

It is for this reasons that we are calling the attention of all teachers, especially the social studies teachers to give more emphasis on teaching values, love of country, respect for the flag, veneration of heroes, and proper behavior during flag ceremonies.

Similar to stories, an editorial has also title to give hint to readers what its content is and an author, the one who write it. There are instances that an editorial article has no title, and the author is not mentioned. The paragraph inside the rectangle presents the introduction of the editorial where you can write the explanation of the topic or issue. Those paragraphs with underline give you the body of the editorial where you can present your opposition, pull in other facts, give your stand regarding the issue by supporting it with reasons from strong to strongest order. The paragraph inside an oval gives the conclusion where you can express solutions to the problem. You can persuade or challenge the reader to be informed on this part. Learning Task 1 Rewrite the editorial statements in paragraph form in their proper order. 1. One can hardly write on them without a thick sheet of paper for a pad. Outside the classrooms, some desks are placed for the students to sit on. Students really take advantage of them. They sit on top of the desks and place their muddy shoes on the seats instead. 2.

When the 220 new desks for Pasig Line will be made available for the students' use, will they end up the way most desks go go? 4. The Way of Most Desks Learning Task 2 Directions: Read the following statements carefully.

                            27. 1. Read the provided essay.
2. Create a critique of the topic and evaluate whether or not the text is worth sharing
with other people.
Life without a car is hard, especially when you live in the Philippines. The chaos that people
I have to go through just to go work and get home using public transportation is such a
hassle. It is very time consuming, so instead of enjoying the hours left in a day with your
family, you spend them jostling with other commuters and struggling to find a ride instead.
But owning a car has its own pros and cons.
On the positive side, having a car gives you more time to do what you want, like go on trips
with your friends and carpool with your officemates. You can also travel to and from work
in comfort.
As for the negative, not everyone can afford to buy a car with cold, hard cash, meaning, you
have to pay for the car in monthly installments on top of your usual bills. You also have to
consider the fuel costs, car maintenance costs, and toll fees. As for me? I think a bit more
expense is worth it if it means I get to spend more time with my loved ones and do the
things I love.</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>The topic presented is a personal opinion on the pros and cons of owning a car in the Philippines. The writer discusses the inconvenience of relying on public transportation and the benefits of owning a car. They acknowledge the financial burden that comes with owning a car but believe that the additional expense is worth the benefits it provides.</p><p></p><p>While the writer's personal experience and perspective are valid, the article could benefit from a more in-depth analysis of the issue. For instance, the article does not consider the environmental impact of owning a car, which is a significant concern in the modern world. Additionally, the writer does not consider alternative modes of transportation, such as bicycles or motorcycles, which could provide similar benefits at a lower cost.</p><p></p><p>Furthermore, the article lacks statistical evidence or research to back up the claims made, which would have added credibility to the author's opinion. The writer could have provided additional sources and data to support their argument and provide a more well-rounded view of the topic.</p><p></p><p>Overall, the article provides a personal opinion on owning a car in the Philippines, but it lacks a thorough analysis of the issue. It could benefit from more research and evidence to support the author's perspective. However, the topic is still worth sharing with others as it can initiate a conversation on the pros and cons of owning a car and encourage people to consider alternative modes of transportation.</p><br />
