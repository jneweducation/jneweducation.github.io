                                            A small one-story reinforced concrete building is idealized for purposes of structural analysis as a massless frame supporting a total dead load of 10 kips at the beam level. The building is located on sloping ground, and the beam is made much stiffer than the columns and can be assumed to be rigid. Each column has a 10-in-square cross section (10 in x 10 in), and the Young's modulus of the concrete is 3000 ksi. Determine the natural period of the structure. 12 24' 24'</a>

                            25. A small one-story reinforced concrete building is idealized for purposes of structural analysis as a massless frame supporting a total dead load of 10 kips at the beam level. The building is located on sloping ground, and the beam is made much stiffer than the columns and can be assumed to be rigid. Each column has a 10-in-square cross section (10 in x 10 in), and the Young's modulus of the concrete is 3000 ksi. Determine the natural period of the structure. 12 24' 24'</h2><br />
