                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>r 27, 2019
</p><p>HIS 101 Mrs. Fazio
</p><p>How To Travel Solo Successfully
</p><p>James Baldwin said it best. “I met a lot of people in Europe. I even encountered myself” 
</p><p>(Baldwin, 2014). Solo travel will not only reveal colorful new heights, it will also introduce you 
</p><p>to yourself - your resiliency, your sense of adventure, your independence. Learning how to 
</p><p>travel solo is as intrinsic as tying your shoes, and it is something that can be learned today.
</p><p>	 The first, most obvious, way to travel solo successfully is to research your area.
</p><p>The number one indicator of a tourist is someone stopped in the middle of the sidewalk 
</p><p>scanning the GPS on their phone. According to World Travel News Report, four in fifteen
</p><p>tourists will be pickpocketed if they stand still on a busy street (Parker, 2019). Arrive 
</p><p>well-informed on the area. Understand the public transportation system to the point where 
</p><p>you can blend in as a local. 
</p><p>Also in line with safety, you may want to splurge on accommodations. You can 
</p><p>stay alone in a hostel, but read the reviews carefully. Make sure it is in a safe area and 
</p><p>security is a priority for them. You might even want to consider a private room, some of 
</p><p>which include a private bath. 
</p><p>In terms of fun, pack for your lack of companionship. Bring a blank journal to record 
</p><p>your adventures. Pack a paperback to enjoy while you wait out a rainstorm in a coffee shop. 
</p><p>World traveler Samantha Byrnes says, “I never travel with friends. When I’m exploring a new
</p><p>continent, my journal is my only sidekick” (Byrnes, 2018). 
</p><p>This allows her to absorb her new surroundings, make new acquaintances, and 
</p><p>focus on the act of encountering herself. Byrnes continues, “We lost sight of ourselves in 
</p><p>the day-to-day. We focus on work, family, to-do lists, chores. Solo travel allows us to return 
</p><p>to ourselves so that, when we resume our day-to-day activities, we can give our all”
</p><p>(Byrnes, 2018). 
</p><p>Learning how to travel solo successfully is an achievable feat. You can stay safe if 
</p><p>you remain knowledgeable on the area and choose your accommodations wisely. Beyond 
</p><p>that, you can experience true transformation through the simple act of carrying a tattered
</p><p>old journal. What do you say? Will you explore solo travel? Choose wisely, for it just might
</p><p>change your life forever.

                            2. How to travel solo successfully</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Always stay in hostels. There are multiple advantages of staying in hostels. The most obvious advantage is that most of the hostels are very cheap, compared to hotels. However, the less obvious but more important advantage of staying in hostels lies in the fact that you get the chance to bond with other backpackers across the globe. I have stayed in rooms where every roommate was from a different continent, and we spent hours talking and learning about different cultures. Most of the hostels also organize events and games every night, adding to the fun.
</p><p>Travel light. Believe me, life becomes crazily easier if you are travelling with just a backpack. You can then focus on enjoying the journey, instead of worrying about safe places to keep your luggage. I once went on a month long Eurotrip with just a small backpack, and it was one of the most convenient trips I had. I could stay wherever I wanted, and go wherever I wanted at a moment’s notice without any worry.
</p><p>Don’t be afraid to experiment. Travelling exposes you to different cultures and food types. Don’t be afraid to experiment and go out of your comfort zone. You might stumble upon hidden passions you never knew you had. The first time I danced Salsa was in Europe, and I have been dancing ever since.
</p><p>If you are backpacking across Europe over a long duration, buy a Eurail pass. Eurail passes are the most convenient and cheapest way to travel across multiple European countries. The train connectivity in Europe is great, and the Eurail passes also allow you to enjoy discounts in some of the hostels, restaurants, cruises or museums.
</p><p>Don’t do typical touristy things. When I travel, I like experiencing the real culture of the country, instead of visiting the typical tourist traps like popular museums or landmarks. I prefer visiting the local places, hang out with the locals and also eat the local food.
</p><p>Try to travel off-season. Wherever possible, try to travel off-season. You would be able to visit the same places at a lower price. The crowd would be significantly less, allowing you to enjoy the locations more, avoid queues and also capture better pictures. I visited Croatia during the winters a couple of years back, and found it much more convenient to experience the city without the usual crowd.
</p><p>Be flexible with your schedule. Travelling solo allows you to be the master of your own schedule. If you enjoy a place more, stay longer. Allow yourself to get lost, without worrying about time. I was once crossing across Slovenia when I chanced upon the magnificent Lake Bled. I got down from the train then and there, and ended up spending significant time just strolling across the lake. It was an unplanned detour, but resulted in a lifelong memory.
</p><p>Travelling solo is an amazing feeling. You can go wherever you want and do whatever you want. You can make friends all over the world, all while creating memories you will cherish forever.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>Here are a few safety tips for traveling alone:
</p><p>Do your homework before you arrive. ...
</p><p>Choose the right accommodations. ...
</p><p>Trust yourself. ...
</p><p>Carry good identification—in more than one place. ...
</p><p>Stick to open and public places, especially at night.
</p><p>Exude confidence. ...
</p><p>Avoid appearing like a tourist. ...
</p><p>Leave valuables at home.</p><br />

                        <p>Challenges are stones that we have to step on and overcome for us to be better persons and to further prepare us for bigger roles in the future.  They serve as learning mechanisms for us to grow.  In order to overcome them, we have to learn to <strong>face them courageously</strong> first.  Fear should not limit our ability to be victorious over them.
</p><p>
</p><p>Facing our challenges can never be tough enough once we get to it.  It may seem that we are finally overcoming them until we find ourselves sulking over the sufferings and trials once again.  Overcoming is not possible if we do not break and hurt and lose for a while.  We overcome by <strong>constantly moving forward</strong> even if the steps are hard to see and grasp.
</p><p>
</p><p>We can never overcome our challenges if we let them break us and never bother to stand up once again.  It is in bravery and perseverance that we become victorious.  <strong>We do not give up, but we learn when to pause and rest.  We fight but then we also choose the right battles to fight for.

                            29. How to travel solo successfully​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p><strong>Walk With Confidence</strong></p><p><strong>Building confidence is one of the first tips for traveling solo successfully. You can do this by pre-planning your route, activities, and expenses. In this case, you can't be too over-prepared. Knowing that you did your homework will allow you to walk confidently. If someone asks you for directions, take it as a compliment. Congratulations! You look like you know what you’re doing. </strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong>Pack Light</strong></p><p><strong>One of the biggest mistakes you can make as a female solo traveler is packing too much stuff. As much as possible, you want to be able to take care of yourself without needing assistance. Packing essentials (read: only as much as you can carry) makes sense. Be smart about the pieces of clothing you decide to bring. Layer lighter pieces instead of bringing thick and heavy clothes. Decide on a color palette beforehand and pack accordingly. Transfer toiletries into smaller containers. Carry comfortable and versatile footwear.</strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong>Carry a Personal Hygiene Kit</strong></p><p><strong>These days, having a go bag is a must. No, you don’t need to bring water filters or hypothermia blankets (unless you want to), but you do have to carry new essentials. These include basic medicine, extra face masks, alcohol or hand sanitizer, and the like. If you’re unsure about the quality of amenities at your hotel or hostel, pack your own. And not that we need to tell you, but don’t forget your skincare products, too.</strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong>For soft, manageable hair and hassle-free styling, use Cream Silk Ultimate Reborn Damage Control Conditioner after you shampoo. It can help revitalize your locks after extended sun exposure. Apply POND'S Bright Sunscreen SPF 50 PA+++ on your face to protect your skin while you explore new destinations. For your body, use Vaseline Gluta-Hya Serum Burst Lotion Flawless Glow to rehydrate dry skin. These come in travel-size packs and sachets that will easily fit in your carry-on luggage.</strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong>-Choose your destination and book your accommodation.</strong></p><p><strong>-Prepare but not too much.</strong></p><p><strong>-Prepare yourself mentally.</strong></p><p><strong>-Pack cleverly according to your destination.</strong></p><p><strong>-Provide a plan B for transport.</strong></p><p><strong>-Talk about it with those close to you.</strong></p><p><strong>-Do some research on your destination and solo travelling.</strong></p><p></p><br />

                            30. If you are to proposed a service type of business, discuss how you would successfully record business transactions and report a financial information.​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p><strong>Question</strong><strong>:</strong><strong> </strong><strong>if</strong><strong> </strong><strong>you are to proposed a service type of business, discuss how you would successfully record business transactions and report a financial information.</strong></p><p></p><p><strong>Answer</strong><strong>:</strong></p><p></p><p>If I am going to record a transactions and report a <strong>financial</strong><strong> </strong><strong>information</strong><strong>,</strong><strong> </strong><strong>I</strong><strong> </strong><strong>will</strong><strong> </strong><strong>use</strong><strong> </strong><strong>the</strong><strong> </strong><strong>journal</strong><strong> </strong><strong>entries</strong><strong>.</strong><strong> </strong></p><p></p><p><strong>Journal</strong> <strong>entries</strong><strong>.</strong> The most basic method used to record a transaction is the journal entry, where the accountant manually enters the account numbers and debits and credits for each individual transaction. This approach is time-consuming and subject to error, and so is usually reserved for adjustments and special entries. </p><p></p><p>#READYTOHELP </p><br />
