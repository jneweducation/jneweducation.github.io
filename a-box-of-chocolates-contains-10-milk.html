Exercise No. 2 
Directions: Determine if each event is mutually exclusive or non-mutually exclusive. Then, solve for its probability.
1. A card is randomly selected from a deck of 52 cards. What is the probability that it is a king or an ace?
2. A card is randomly drawn from a standard deck of cards. What is the probability that the card is a red card or a face card?
3. Super Typhoon Yolanda caused damages in Leyte amounting to billions of pesos. After a relief effort, 500 people in a certain community were surveyed to determine if they donated food or money. From the result of the survey, 160 people donated food, 130 people donated money, and 90 donated both. If a member of the community was selected at random, what is the probability that he/she donated food or money?
Exercise No. 3
Determine whether the events are independent or dependent. Solve for the probability.

                            5. 2. A box of chocolates contains 10 milk chocolates, 8 dark chocolates, and 6 white chocolates. Hanissa randomly chooses a chocolate, eats it, and then randomly chooses another chocolate. What is the probability that Hanissa chose a milk chocolate, and then, a white chocolate?</h2><br />
                        There are a total of 24 chocolates in the box. <br /><br />The probability of choosing a milk chocolate on the first pick is 10/24. <br /><br />After eating the first chocolate, there are 23 chocolates left, with 6 white chocolates remaining. <br /><br />So the probability of choosing a white chocolate on the second pick, given that a milk chocolate was chosen first, is 6/23. <br /><br />To find the probability of both events happening, we multiply the probabilities: <br /><br />(10/24) x (6/23) = 15/92 <br /><br />Therefore, the probability that Hanissa chose a milk chocolate, and then a white chocolate is 15/92.<br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>1. Allan can keep a maximum of 16 fish in his aquarium if each fish needs at least 0.5 cubic feet of water.</p><p>2. The volume of the chocolate box is 576 cubic cm.</p><p>3. Therefore, the height of the cylindrical tank is approximately 1.14 meters.</p><p>4. Therefore, the chocolate milk container can hold 135 cubic centimeters of chocolate milk.</p><p>5. Therefore, the volume of the right circular cone-shaped building is approximately 461.8141 cm^3.</p><p><strong>Step-by-step explanation:</strong></p><p></p><p>1. To determine the maximum number of fish that Allan can keep in his aquarium, we need to calculate the volume of the aquarium and divide it by the minimum amount of water each fish needs. 
</p><p>
The volume of the aquarium can be calculated as:
</p><p>
Volume = Length x Width x Height
</p><p>
Volume = 4 ft x 1 ft x 2 ft
</p><p>
Volume = 8 cubic feet

</p><p>Since each fish needs at least 0.5 cubic feet of water, we can calculate the maximum number of fish as:

</p><p>Maximum Number of Fish = Volume / Water per Fish

</p><p>Maximum Number of Fish = 8 cubic feet / 0.5 cubic feet per fish
</p><p>Maximum Number of Fish = 16 fish
</p><p>
Therefore, Allan can keep a maximum of 16 fish in his aquarium if each fish needs at least 0.5 cubic feet of water.</p><p></p><p>2. To find the volume of the chocolate box, we need to multiply its length, height, and width. 
</p><p>
Volume = Length x Height x Width
</p><p>
Volume = 12 cm x 8 cm x 6 cm
</p><p>
Volume = 576 cubic cm
</p><p>
Therefore, the volume of the chocolate box is 576 cubic cm.</p><p></p><p>3. The height of the cylindrical tank can be found using the formula for the volume of a cylinder: 
</p><p>
volume = πr^2h
</p><p>
where r is the radius and h is the height. 
</p><p>
Rearranging this formula, we get:
</p><p>
h = volume / (πr^2)
</p><p>
Substituting the given values, we get:
</p><p>
h = 44 / (π x 3.5^2)
</p><p>
h ≈ 1.14 meters
</p><p>
Therefore, the height of the cylindrical tank is approximately 1.14 meters.</p><p></p><p>4. The volume of a rectangular prism is given by the formula </p><p>V=lwh where l is the length, w is the width, and h is the height of the prism.</p><p>In this case, the chocolate milk container has a length of 5 cm, a width of 3 cm, and a height of 9 cm. Substituting these values into the formula, we get:</p><p> =(5cm)(3cm)(9cm)=</p><p> 135cm³</p><p>V=(5cm)(3cm)(9cm)=135cm³ </p><p>Therefore, the chocolate milk container can hold 135 cubic centimeters of chocolate milk.</p><p></p><p>5. To find the volume of a right circular cone-shaped building with a height of 9 cm and a radius base of 7 cm, you can use the formula V = (1/3)πr^2h, where V is the volume, r is the radius of the base, and h is the height. 
</p><p>
Substituting the given values, we get:
</p><p>
V = (1/3) × π × 7^2 × 9
</p><p>  = (1/3) × π × 441 × 9
</p><p>  ≈ 461.8141 cm^3
</p><p>
Therefore, the volume of the right circular cone-shaped building is approximately 461.8141 cm^3.</p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>There are 24 chocolates in total, and Hanissa has to choose a milk chocolate first, and then a white chocolate. The probability of choosing a milk chocolate first is 10/24, since there are 10 milk chocolates out of 24 chocolates in total. After Hanissa eats the milk chocolate, there are 23 chocolates left in the box, and 6 of them are white chocolates. Therefore, the probability of choosing a white chocolate second is 6/23.</p><p></p><p>To find the probability of both events happening, we multiply the probability of choosing a milk chocolate first by the probability of choosing a white chocolate second, given that a milk chocolate was already chosen. This gives:</p><p></p><p>(10/24) x (6/23) = 0.0652 or approximately 0.07 (rounded to two decimal places)</p><p></p><p>Therefore, the probability that Hanissa chose a milk chocolate, and then a white chocolate is approximately 0.07 or 7%.</p><p><strong>Haruki </strong><strong>Nezugazawa. </strong></p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>7. The volume of the aquarium is 4 ft x 1 ft x 2 ft = 8 cubic feet. Dividing the volume of the aquarium by the volume of water needed for one fish gives us 8 ft3 ÷ 0.5 ft3/fish = 16 fish. Therefore, Allan can keep a maximum of 16 fish in the aquarium.</p><p></p><p>8. The formula for the volume of a cylinder is V = πr^2h, where V is the volume, r is the radius, and h is the height. Rearranging the formula, we get h = V/πr^2. Substituting the given values, we have h = 44 m^3/(π x 3.5 m)^2 = 1.5 m. Therefore, the tank is 1.5 meters high.</p><p></p><p>9. The volume of the rectangular prism is the product of its length, width, and height. Therefore, the volume is 5 cm x 3 cm x 9 cm = 135 cubic centimeters.</p><p></p><p>10. The formula for the volume of a right circular cone is V = (1/3)πr^2h, where V is the volume, r is the radius, and h is the height. Substituting the given values, we have V = (1/3)π(7 cm)^2(9 cm) = 220.44 cubic centimeters. Therefore, the volume of the cone-shaped building is approximately 220.44 cubic centimeters.</p><br />
