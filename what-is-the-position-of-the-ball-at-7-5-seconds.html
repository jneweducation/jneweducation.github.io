The vertically launched projectiles always have an upward negative increasing verticalvelocity. After reaching at the maximum trajectory, it will descend at a decreasing positivevertical velocity because gravity makes it accelerates downward at a rate of 9.8 m/s.8.At the top of the projectile's flight, there is no gravity that make projectiles start to fall9. The horizontal velocity of a vertically launched projectile has constant magnitude and samedirection as the launch. Hence, its acceleration is zero.10.An object projected horizontally will reach the ground at the same time as an objectdropped vertically.​</a>
