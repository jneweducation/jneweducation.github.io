A well - defined function from a sample space to the set of real numbers is called a _______________________. It is commonly denoted by capital letters, such as X, Y and Z. The specific values of a random variable is denoted by small letters such as x, y, and z.2. A random variable is a _______________________if its set of possible outcomes is countable. Mostly, discrete random variable represents count data, such as the number of enrolled students in a particular school.3. A random variable is _______________________if it takes on values on a continuous scale. Often, continuous random variables represent measured data, such as heights, weights temperatures and lifespan.Can you help me? :&lt;​</a>

(traits are listed be Include the following: A legend (see example below) ● First names of all members A title detailing what trait will you explore Indicate people with the trait, carriers, and people without the trait (Note: if it is a dominant trait, there carriers, only people who have it or not.) Indicate whether the trait is dominant (represented in genetics with a capital letter e.g. "Y") or recessiv gene whose effect is not expressed. Represented in genetics with a small letter e.g. "y" ● Create a Punnett square of 2 people with known genotypes. What are the possible offspring's genotyp organism's complete set of genetic material) and phenotype (is the set of observable characteristics or an organism.

A well - defined function from a sample space to the set of real numbers is called a _______________________. It is commonly denoted by capital letters, such as X, Y and Z. The specific values of a random variable is denoted by small letters such as x, y, and z.2. A random variable is a _______________________if its set of possible outcomes is countable. Mostly, discrete random variable represents count data, such as the number of enrolled students in a particular school.3. A random variable is _______________________if it takes on values on a continuous scale. Often, continuous random variables represent measured data, such as heights, weights temperatures and lifespan.Can you help me? :&lt;​</h2><br />
