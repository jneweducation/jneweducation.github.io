We need to know first the (2) _______________________ , it is something that is stationary and fixed. You can determine whether an object moves by comparing its position to that of a fixed point. The (3) _____________________ is a scalar quantity that refers to “how much ground an object has covered" during its motion. The total length covered by moving body or the entire path that the object travelled. While (4) ____________________ is a vector quantity that refers to "how far out of place an object is". It is the object's overall change in position. It refers to the shortest distance between the object’s two positions, like the distance between its point of origin and its point of destination, no matter what path it took to get to that destination. The distance covered in a unit of time also known as (5) ________________________ can be defined as “how fast something moves” and (6) ______________________ can be defined as “speed having direction”.The greater the (7) _______________________ acting on an object, the more it will (8) __________________________.

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Measurement of heat is done in calories. One calorie is the amount of energy required to raise one gram of water one degree Celsius. To measure heat, you divide the change in temperature of a sample of water by the mass of the water. Well the way we can measure that heat is by using something called the Calorie.</p><br />

                            6. FOLLOW THE STEPS IN SOLVING PROBLEM, IDENTIFY THE GIVEN, FORMULA TO BE USED, CONVERSION OF UNITS IF THERE ARE AND YOUR COMPLETE SOLUTION. 1. A cylinder of compressed gas has a volume of 85 dm3 (cubic decimeter) and a pressure of 984 kPa. What volume will the gas occupy if allowed to escape into a balloon at a pressure of 1, 015 torr. Assume that the temperature does not change. 2. At 0°C and 5 atm, a given sample of gas occupies 75 L. The gas is compressed to a final volume of 30 L at 0°C. What is the final pressure in mmHg? 3. A sample of gas has a volume of 20L at 1.5 atm. By how much will the volume increase or decrease at each of the following.pressures: a. 700 mmHg b. 2.4 atm c. 105 kPa 4. A sample pf gas occupies a volume of 385 mL under a pressure of 0 .75 atm. If the volume is increased by 15. 0 mL what will be new pressure?WRITTEN WORK #2(Charles's Law)16.   A 142 mL of gas is measured at 48°C. At constant pressure of 1 atm, what wil.be the volume of the gas at 15°C?17. A 240 cm3 volume of gas is collected at 332 K. What volume in Liters would the gas occupy at standard temperature provided that the pressure is held constant?18. At constant pressure of 990 mmHg, a sample of hydrogen gas initially at 85°C and 7.4 L is cooled until its final volume is increased by 2.1 L. What is its final temperature?19.
