                                            Amelia Earheart: The Lady LindyAmelia Mary Earhart was born in Atchison, Kansas, on July 24, 1897.During Christmas vacation in 1917 at an aviation expo, a pilot flew his planenear her. Latershe said, "I believe that little red airplane said something to meas it swished by." However, a 10-minute plane ride in December 1920 changedher life. "By the time I had got two or three hundred feet off the ground, I knew Ihad to fly," she said.She purchased her first plane, a bright yellow, second-hand biplane that shenamed The Canary and she eventually achieved the world altitude record for womenpilots 14 000 feet in October 1922. She became an aviation celebrity and thepress dubbed her "Lady Lindy.” George P. Putnam, who published many storiesabout Charles Lindbergh, took on Earhart's story as his next bestseller. Earhartmarried Putnam and worked closely during appearances, lectures and otherpromotions on many industries including women's fashion, magazines and airlinemanagement. Her true passion, however, always remained with flying. She set aworld record for altitude, reaching 18,415 feet, and became president of The Ninety-Nines, an organization dedicated to women's aviation. For some time, Earhart andPutnam worked secretly on plans for Earhart to make a solo flight across theAtlantic. This would be the first woman and second solo person to make the flight.On June 1, 1937. Earhart and her navigator, Fred Noonan, departedfrom Miami with great fanfare. They began the 29,000-mile journey heading east.After 29 days of flight, they touched down in Lae, New Guinea. When Earhartand Noonan took off from Lae, they encountered problems over the Pacific withovercast skies and rain showers early on. As they neared Howland Island, theywere unable to make sufficient connection with the Itasca or to land on theisland. Though the Itasca began a rescue attempt immediately and the searchcontinued for weeks, nothing was found. On January 5, 1939, Earhart wasdeclared legally dead. Her disappearance during this attempt to fly around theworld is a mystery that continues to intrigue people worldwide.Antoine Marie Jean-Baptiste Roger de Saint-Exupery's LifeAntoine de Saint-Exupery (1900-1944), a French writer and aviator. He wasborn in Lyon and educated at the University of Fribourg. He joined the French AirForce in 1921 and became a commercial pilot in 1926.9His first two books, Southern Mail (1929) and Night flight (1931), are novelsdistinguished by a poetic evocation of the romance and discipline of flying, whichrequires devotion to duty at the risk of death. His later works, including Wind,Sand and Stars (1939), and Flight to Arras (1942), stress the humanisticPhilosophy of Saint-Exupery. His popular children's book The Little Prince (1943)is also read by adults for its allegorical meaning,During World War II, Saint-Exupery rejoined the French Air Force, was shot,escaped to the United States, and later joined the Free French Forces. On areconnaissance mission over southern France in 1944, his plane was lost. Theremains of the aircraft were not found until 2004 when scuba divers recovered atailpiece bearing the serial number of the aircraft Saint-Exupery was flying, aLockheed P-38 Lightning. The cause of the crash is still unknown. Saint-Exupery'snotebooks, collected under the title "Wisdom of the Sands" (1948), were publishedposthumously.​</a>

                                            ANSWER PLSSS ASAP Text A I firmly believe that there is a colony of goblins living inside the moon, and the government is keeping this information from you. How do we know this ? Look at the moon! See that little squiggle? You were taught that was just a crater, but it isn't. It is actually actually the tip of an enermous goblin moon base. How do I know that? the goblins told me so. I have special phone line from my house to the moon- goblins, and through me, they can answer any question you've got. Our moon-door is always open, the goblins tell me. Text B Earth has just one moon - a rocky, cratered place, roughly a quarter the size of Earth and an average of 238,855 miles away. The Moon can be seen with the naked eye most nights as it traces its 27-day orbit around our planet. Chances are that when you imagine the night sky, one of the first things that comes to mind is the Moon "glowing" in the darkness. The Moon has always held a special place in our imaginations and in daily life. It's no wonder that we are fascinated. The Moon is Earth's only natural satellite and one that we can easily see most nights. What makes the Moon glow? The Moon does not shine with its own light. It simply reflects light coming shape each night from the Sun. Why does it look like the Moon is changing shape? From Earth, it might look like the Moon is our spot on Earth, we see - from a tiny sliver to a half moon to a full moon and back again. What's actually happening is that from different parts of the Moon lit up by the Sun as the Moon travels in its orbit. Is there actually a "dark side" of the Moon? No. The Moon rotates on its own axis at the same rate that it orbits around Earth. That means we always see the same side of the Moon from our position on Earth. The side we don't see gets just as much light, so a more accurate name for that part of the Moon is the "far side. "Even thousands of years ago, humans drew pictures to track the changes of the Moon. Later, people used their observations of the Moon to create calendars. Today, we study the Moon using telescopes and spacecraft. For example, NASA's Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter has been circling the Moon and sending back measurements since 2009. The Moon is the only other planetary body that humans have visited. On July 20, 1969, NASA astronauts Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin were the first people to set foot on the dusty surface of the Moon. Ten other American astronauts followed. They collected hundreds of pounds of lunar soil and rock samples, conducted experiments and installed equipment for follow-up measurements. Using a Venn Diagram compare the two text.

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Give the definition of the following:  </p><p><strong>Intelligence</strong> - Intelligence has been defined in many ways: the capacity for abstraction, logic, understanding, self-awareness, learning, emotional knowledge, reasoning, planning, creativity, critical thinking, and problem-solving.  </p><p><strong>Morse Code </strong>- Morse code is a method used in telecommunication to encode text characters as standardized sequences of two different signal durations, called dots and dashes, or dits and dahs. Morse code is named after Samuel Morse, one of the inventors of the telegraph.
</p><p><strong>
</strong></p><p><strong>Kind of Spies </strong>
</p><p><strong>Counter Intelligence </strong>- Counterintelligence is an activity aimed at protecting an agency's intelligence program from an opposition's intelligence service.  </p><p><strong>Strategic Intelligence</strong> - Strategic intelligence is information that is needed to formulate policy and military plans at the international and national policy levels. Tactical intelligence is intended primarily to respond to the needs of military field commanders so they can plan for and, if necessary, conduct combat operations.
</p><p><strong>Operational Intelligence </strong>- operational intelligence. Intelligence that is required for planning and conducting campaigns and major operations to accomplish strategic objectives within theaters or operational areas.
</p><p><strong>Surveillance Reconnaissance</strong>- ISTAR stands for intelligence, surveillance, target acquisition, and reconnaissance. In its macroscopic sense, ISTAR is a practice that links several battlefield functions together to assist a combat force in employing its sensors and managing the information they gather.  </p><p><strong> Informer and Informant </strong>- An informer is the person revealing confidential information in return for money (usually). So a police informer is an 'insider' in the target organisation secretly helping or working for the police. An informant is someone who sees or witnesses something and reports the matter (to the authorities).

                            6. Amelia Earheart: The Lady LindyAmelia Mary Earhart was born in Atchison, Kansas, on July 24, 1897.During Christmas vacation in 1917 at an aviation expo, a pilot flew his planenear her. Latershe said, "I believe that little red airplane said something to meas it swished by." However, a 10-minute plane ride in December 1920 changedher life. "By the time I had got two or three hundred feet off the ground, I knew Ihad to fly," she said.She purchased her first plane, a bright yellow, second-hand biplane that shenamed The Canary and she eventually achieved the world altitude record for womenpilots 14 000 feet in October 1922. She became an aviation celebrity and thepress dubbed her "Lady Lindy.” George P. Putnam, who published many storiesabout Charles Lindbergh, took on Earhart's story as his next bestseller. Earhartmarried Putnam and worked closely during appearances, lectures and otherpromotions on many industries including women's fashion, magazines and airlinemanagement. Her true passion, however, always remained with flying. She set aworld record for altitude, reaching 18,415 feet, and became president of The Ninety-Nines, an organization dedicated to women's aviation. For some time, Earhart andPutnam worked secretly on plans for Earhart to make a solo flight across theAtlantic. This would be the first woman and second solo person to make the flight.On June 1, 1937. Earhart and her navigator, Fred Noonan, departedfrom Miami with great fanfare. They began the 29,000-mile journey heading east.After 29 days of flight, they touched down in Lae, New Guinea. When Earhartand Noonan took off from Lae, they encountered problems over the Pacific withovercast skies and rain showers early on. As they neared Howland Island, theywere unable to make sufficient connection with the Itasca or to land on theisland. Though the Itasca began a rescue attempt immediately and the searchcontinued for weeks, nothing was found. On January 5, 1939, Earhart wasdeclared legally dead. Her disappearance during this attempt to fly around theworld is a mystery that continues to intrigue people worldwide.Antoine Marie Jean-Baptiste Roger de Saint-Exupery's LifeAntoine de Saint-Exupery (1900-1944), a French writer and aviator. He wasborn in Lyon and educated at the University of Fribourg. He joined the French AirForce in 1921 and became a commercial pilot in 1926.9His first two books, Southern Mail (1929) and Night flight (1931), are novelsdistinguished by a poetic evocation of the romance and discipline of flying, whichrequires devotion to duty at the risk of death. His later works, including Wind,Sand and Stars (1939), and Flight to Arras (1942), stress the humanisticPhilosophy of Saint-Exupery. His popular children's book The Little Prince (1943)is also read by adults for its allegorical meaning,During World War II, Saint-Exupery rejoined the French Air Force, was shot,escaped to the United States, and later joined the Free French Forces. On areconnaissance mission over southern France in 1944, his plane was lost. Theremains of the aircraft were not found until 2004 when scuba divers recovered atailpiece bearing the serial number of the aircraft Saint-Exupery was flying, aLockheed P-38 Lightning. The cause of the crash is still unknown. Saint-Exupery'snotebooks, collected under the title "Wisdom of the Sands" (1948), were publishedposthumously.​</h2><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p><strong>What methods might you use to protect yourself against reconnaissance attacks</strong><strong>?</strong><strong> </strong></p><p></p><p> Reconnaissance attacks are usually done using information gathering tools and techniques starting from the simple whois.com (to look up domain names and contact information) and nslookup (translates the domain name to its IP hosting address), to more functional tools such as nmap (port-scanning and analyzing machine. </p><p> <strong>The best method to mitigate these attacks is by the use of cryptographic encryption.</strong></p><p></p><p><strong>Can you think of any other ways a Denial of Service (DoS) attack could be carried out, and what the impact might be?</strong></p><p></p><p>Some common examples of DDoS attacks are UDP flooding, SYN flooding and DNS amplification.</p><p></p><p><strong>UDP</strong><strong> </strong><strong>FLOODING</strong><strong>:</strong></p><p></p><p>A <strong>UDP</strong> <strong>flood</strong> attack is a volumetric denial-of-service attack using the User Datagram Protocol, a sessionless/connectionless computer networking protocol. Using UDP for denial-of-service attacks is not as straightforward as with the Transmission Control Protocol. </p><p></p><p><strong>SYN</strong><strong> </strong><strong>FLOODING</strong><strong>:</strong></p><p></p><p></p><p>A <strong>SYN</strong> <strong>flood</strong> is a form of denial-of-service attack in which an attacker rapidly initiates a connection to a server without finalizing the connection. The server has to spend resources waiting for half-opened connections, which can consume enough resources to make the system unresponsive to legitimate traffic. </p><p></p><p><strong>DNS</strong><strong> </strong><strong>AMPLIFICATION</strong><strong>:</strong></p><p></p><p><strong>Common</strong> <strong>ways</strong> to prevent or mitigate the impact of DNS amplification attacks include tightening DNS server security, blocking specific DNS servers or all open recursive relay servers, and rate limiting.</p><p></p><p>#READYTOHELP </p><br />

                        <p>Answer:</p><p></p><p>U.N.

Monitoring, Verification, and Inspection Commission, said he was unaware if the Iraqi air force had tried to intercept the planes.</p><p></p><p>But a U.S. official said Iraq "informed us when the planes were in the air that only one was acceptable and the second would be viewed as 'hostile."'</p><p></p><p>He said the inspectors asked Washington to temporarily suspend the flights, flown on behalf of the United Nations, until U.S. and U.N. officials could meet on the incident in New York. Iraq, the U.S. official said, had been told about the two aircraft 48 hours in advance.</p><p></p><p>Should Iraq be found to have interfered with the flights, chief U.N. inspector Hans Blix, executive chairman of UNMOVIC, is obligated to report the incident to the U.N. Security Council immediately.</p><p></p><p>But Russia's U.N. ambassador, Sergei Lavrov, whose country opposes military action against Iraq, contended that "UNMOVIC is not considering it a provocation." He said the incident was a "misunderstanding" and "blown out of proportion."</p><p></p><p>Buchanan told reporters, "I can confirm that two U-2 reconnaissance aircraft operating on behalf of the UNMOVIC operated in Iraqi air space this morning."</p><p></p><p>"Although Iraq had been notified of a flight time window, they expressed surprise and concern that two flights were operating simultaneously. In the interests of safety, UNMOVIC requested the aircraft to withdraw," he said, adding that further U-2 and Mirage flights were still planned.</p><p></p><p>U.N. sources said there was no agreement that only one U-2 aircraft could fly at one time, although that had been past practice.</p><p></p><p>WASHINGTON (AP)-Iraqi fighter jets threatened two American U-2 surveillance planes, forcing them to return to abort their mission and return to base, senior U.S. officials said Tuesday.</p><p></p><p>A Pentagon official said the decision to end the mission "in the interest of safety."</p><p></p><p>The U-2 planes were flying missions at 2 a.m. Iraqi time for the U.N. weapons inspectors when Iraq launched fighter jets. According to two of the officials, the threat was directed against one of the two planes, said the officials, speaking on condition of anonymity.</p><p></p><p>Multiple flights are permitted under a U.N. Security Council resolution approved last November, and the Bush administration sought clarification from U.N. inspectors after the U-2 flights were suspended.</p><p></p><p>The U.N. inspection agency, known, as UNMOVIC, had given advance notice to Iraq of the flights, said the U.S. official.</p><p></p><p>The Iraqi threat is fresh evidence of Baghdad's unwillingness to cooperate with U.N. inspectors, another U.S. official said.</p><p></p><p>Two American U-2 planes were already in the air, the senior official said. He said they were the seventh and eighth sent on a surveillance assignment since the council approved the resolution unanimously, and that the flights had been coordinated with the U.N. inspection agency.</p><p></p><p>But Iraq "raised a fuss," this official said, and the two flights were recalled. American diplomats are checking with the U.N. agency before resuming U-2 flights, the official said.</p><p></p><p>The dispute punctuated a behind-the-scenes effort by the United States and Britain to win support for a new resolution designed to back the use of force as a last resort to disarm Iraq.</p><p></p><p>U-2 flights are conducted as part of an elaborate inspection arrangement designed to determine whether President Saddam Hussein has secretly stored chemical and biological weapons in defiance of U.N. resolutions.</p><p></p><p>Typically, Iraq is notified in advance of overflights of Iraqi territory.</p><p></p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>The purpose of this section is to pull together as many influences and manifestations of bias as possible, in a single example.

                            9. ANSWER PLSSS ASAP Text A I firmly believe that there is a colony of goblins living inside the moon, and the government is keeping this information from you. How do we know this ? Look at the moon! See that little squiggle? You were taught that was just a crater, but it isn't. It is actually actually the tip of an enermous goblin moon base. How do I know that? the goblins told me so. I have special phone line from my house to the moon- goblins, and through me, they can answer any question you've got. Our moon-door is always open, the goblins tell me. Text B Earth has just one moon - a rocky, cratered place, roughly a quarter the size of Earth and an average of 238,855 miles away. The Moon can be seen with the naked eye most nights as it traces its 27-day orbit around our planet. Chances are that when you imagine the night sky, one of the first things that comes to mind is the Moon "glowing" in the darkness. The Moon has always held a special place in our imaginations and in daily life. It's no wonder that we are fascinated. The Moon is Earth's only natural satellite and one that we can easily see most nights. What makes the Moon glow? The Moon does not shine with its own light. It simply reflects light coming shape each night from the Sun. Why does it look like the Moon is changing shape? From Earth, it might look like the Moon is our spot on Earth, we see - from a tiny sliver to a half moon to a full moon and back again. What's actually happening is that from different parts of the Moon lit up by the Sun as the Moon travels in its orbit. Is there actually a "dark side" of the Moon? No. The Moon rotates on its own axis at the same rate that it orbits around Earth. That means we always see the same side of the Moon from our position on Earth. The side we don't see gets just as much light, so a more accurate name for that part of the Moon is the "far side. "Even thousands of years ago, humans drew pictures to track the changes of the Moon. Later, people used their observations of the Moon to create calendars. Today, we study the Moon using telescopes and spacecraft. For example, NASA's Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter has been circling the Moon and sending back measurements since 2009. The Moon is the only other planetary body that humans have visited. On July 20, 1969, NASA astronauts Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin were the first people to set foot on the dusty surface of the Moon. Ten other American astronauts followed. They collected hundreds of pounds of lunar soil and rock samples, conducted experiments and installed equipment for follow-up measurements. Using a Venn Diagram compare the two text. Refer to the comprehensive questions below as your guide in writing the content of your diagram. 1. What are the difference between two passages? 2. What are the similarities of the two passages? 3. What is the authors point of view or claims on the first passage? How about for the second author? 4.What are the pieces of evidence that each author shown that their claim is accurate​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Text A:</p><p></p><p>Differences:</p><p>- The author claims that there is a colony of goblins living inside the moon, while text B only provides factual information about the moon.</p><p>- The author of text A claims that the government is keeping this information from the readers.</p><p>- The author of text A claims to have a special phone line to communicate with the goblins living on the moon.</p><p></p><p>Similarities:</p><p>- Both texts are about the moon.</p><p>- Both texts mention that the moon is Earth's only natural satellite.</p><p>- Both texts mention that the moon reflects light from the Sun.</p><p></p><p>Author's point of view or claims:</p><p>- The author of text A believes that there is a colony of goblins living inside the moon, and that the government is keeping this information from the readers.</p><p>- The author of text B presents factual information about the moon without making any claims or expressing a personal point of view.</p><p></p><p>Evidence:</p><p>- The author of text A claims that there is a squiggle on the moon, which they believe is the tip of an enormous goblin moon base. However, no evidence is provided to support this claim, aside from the author's own communication with the goblins living on the moon.</p><p>- The author of text B provides factual information and cites NASA's Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter as an example of a spacecraft that has been circling the moon and sending back measurements. They also mention the moon landings conducted by American astronauts and the collection of lunar soil and rock samples as evidence of human exploration of the moon.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>1. The first passage discusses the belief in a colony of goblins living inside the moon, while the second passage provides factual information about the moon such as its size, distance from Earth, and the way it reflects light from the sun. The first passage is also more imaginative and unrealistic compared to the second passage. </p><p>2. Both passages talk about the moon and its significance in human history. They both also explain how the moon appears to change shape from Earth and clarify that the moon does not shine with its own light. </p><p>3. The author of the first passage has a belief in a colony of goblins living inside the moon, and they claim that the government is hiding this information. The author of the second passage presents factual information and does not express any belief or point of view.</p><p>4. The first author provides no evidence for their claim, aside from saying that the goblins have told them so through a special phone line. The second author provides evidence such as the Moon's size, distance from Earth, the way it reflects light, and information on human exploration of the Moon, including the lunar missions conducted by NASA.</p><p></p><p>Consider</p><p><strong>•Brainliest - Choose this answer as the best answer if you think it is the most helpful and informative.</strong></p><p></p><p>•Upvote/like - Show appreciation for the answer by clicking the upvote or like button.</p><p></p><p>•Comment/critique - Give constructive feedback on the answer, pointing out what is correct and what can be improved.</p><p></p><p>•Rate - Rate the answer on a scale of 1 to 5 based on how helpful it was.</p><p></p><p><strong>•Follow - Click the "Follow" button to stay updated on future answers and posts by the author.</strong></p><p></p><p>#Lazy learning to the rescue</p><p>#God bless</p><p>#Learning fast and easy</p><p>#Accurate answer</p><p>#Chillax</p><p></p><p></p><br />
