                                            Directions: Read the excerpts from Martin Luther King, Jr’s speech “I have a Dream”. Underline the cohesive devices used. Then, identify the type of cohesive device used. Write your answer on the blank. __________ 1. I have a dream that one day this nation will rise up and live out the true meaning of its creed: "We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal." I have a dream that one day on the red hills of Georgia, the sons of former slaves and the sons of former slave owners will be able to sit down together at the table of brotherhood. I have a dream that one day even the state of Mississippi, a state sweltering with the heat of injustice, sweltering with the heat of oppression, will be transformed into an oasis of freedom and justice. __________ 2. And when this happens, and when we allow freedom ring, when we let it ring from every village and every hamlet, from every state and every city, we will be able to speed up that day when all of God's children, black men and white men, Jews and Gentiles, Protestants and Catholics, will be able to join hands and sing in the words of the old Negro spiritual: Free at last! Free at last! Thank God Almighty, we are free at last! __________ 3. And so let freedom ring from the prodigious hilltops of New Hampshire. Let freedom ring from the mighty mountains of New York. Let freedom ring from the heightening Alleghenies of Pennsylvania. Let freedom ring from the snow-capped Rockies of Colorado. Let freedom ring from the curvaceous slopes of California. __________ 4. Go back to Mississippi, go back to Alabama, go back to South Carolina, go back to Georgia, go back to Louisiana, go back to the slums and ghettos of our northern cities, knowing that somehow this situation can and will be changed. __________ 5. When the architects of our republic wrote the magnificent words of the Constitution and the Declaration of Independence, they were signing a promissory note to which every American was to fall heir.​</a>

It seemed as if no one was there. Someone opened the door to his office. There, inside, the employee the ringing telephone. “Sir , the telephone, please. “Yes, yes," and he walked to the door as if someone were waiting outside for him. “No, sir. I mean the telephone." “What? Oh, yes, I was about to answer it, but I was thinking of the accounts you gave me, I'm afraid that I have lost them.” The papers comprising the statement of accounts were in his hand.

I have a dream that one day on the red hills of Georgia, the sons of former slaves and the sons of former slave owners will be able to sit down together at the table of brotherhood. I have a dream that one day even the state of Mississippi, a state sweltering with the heat of injustice, sweltering with the heat of oppression, will be transformed into an oasis of freedom and justice. 
__________ 2. And when this happens, and when we allow freedom ring, when we let it ring from every village and every hamlet, from every state and every city, we will be able to speed up that day when all of God's children, black men and white men, Jews and Gentiles, Protestants and Catholics, will be able to join hands and sing in the words of the old Negro spiritual: Free at last! Free at last! Thank God Almighty, we are free at last! 
__________ 3. And so let freedom ring from the prodigious hilltops of New Hampshire. Let freedom ring from the mighty mountains of New York.

                                            Read the story carefully and do the tasks that follow.WHY DOGS WAG THEIR TAILS(Excerpt: First of Two Parts)(An Adaptation)(1) Once upon a time in a faraway land there lived a rich man who had a pet dog andcat. His only daughter whom he adored so much was living in a place several miles away fromhim. It was his custom to send his dog and cat to her daughter and bring her a present. Thedog was a bit old and had pretty much lost some teeth so he was no longer able to fight. But, healways knew how to find the way. The cat on the other hand was strong and shrewd so theycould help the other.(2) One day the rich man wanted to send a magic ring to his daughter. He called the dobgand cat. He said to the cat " You have shown a lot of character such as being shrewd andprudent so you may carry this magic ring to my daughter but you have to make sure to takegreat care of it." He also said to the dog You are to go with the cat to take this magic ring to mydaughter. Take care not to lose the way and be sure that no one bothers the cat'. Both animalspromised to do their best and went on their way.(3) On the way, they were impelled to cross a wide and deep river. They weredetermined to swim across as there was no bridge and they couldn't find a boat. The dog said tothe cat, "You need to hand me the ring;" "Oh no!", replied the cat. "Did you not remember whatthe master said just what each of us had to do?", "Yes, but you are not very good at swimmingso I can better take good care of it." The cat refused to disobey the master until the dogthreatened to kill the cat. He was left with no choice but to hand over the magic ring.(4) They began swimming but the current was so strong. It took them an hour in gettingover so they were both tired and weak. Just as they were about to come to the other side, thedog accidentally dropped the ring into the water and finding it seems impossible. The cat saidNow, we have to go back home and tell our master that we lost the ring". "Yes" answered thedog, "but I am scared". So they went back home. As they drew near the house the dog's fearOverpowered him that he ran away as fast as he could and was never seen again.(5) The master, surprised to see the cat back so soon, asked " Why are you alone?".The cat was a bit scared to answer at first. Where is the dog?" asked the master again, "Oh! Heran away' replied the cat. "Ran away?" said the master, "What do you mean? "Where is thering? Let me tell you what happened but please do not get angry"(5) When we reached the river bank, the doq asked me to hand him the ring, I refused alot of times but he threatened to kill me so I was left with no choice. The current was so strongand we were having a hard time crossing the river; so, on the way the dog dropped the ring andwe couldn't find it anymore"T told the dog to go back and tell you what happened, but he said he was so scaredthat he ran away as fast as he could".(8) With this, the master made a proclamation that whoever finds his old dog and canbring him back will be rewarded. The dog'can easily Be recognized às he was already old andhas no teeth. The master had also declared that the dog will be punished by cutting off his tail.(9) It was ordered that all the dogs shall take part in the search. Eversince, that time,when one dog meets another, he always says, "Are you the old dog who lost the ring?". If youwere that dog, your tail will be cut off. Then both the dogs show their teeth and wag their tailswhich means no. It was also that time when cats have been afraid of water.​</a>

                                            I say to you today, my friends, even though we face the difficulties of today and
tomorrow, I still have a dream. It is a dream deeply rooted in the American dream. I
have a dream that one day this nation will rise up and live out the true meaning of its
creed, “We hold these truths to be self-evident; that all men are created equal.” I have a
dream that one day on the red hills of Georgia, sons of former slaves and the sons of
former slave owners will be able to sit down together at the table of brotherhood. I have
a dream that one day even the state of Mississippi, a state sweltering with the heat of
injustice, sweltering with the heat of oppression, will be transformed into an oasis of
freedom and justice. I have a dream that my four little children will one day live in a
nation where they will not be judged by the color of their skin, but by the content of their
character.
I have a dream today!
I have a dream that one day down in Alabama—with its vicious racists, with its
Governor having his lips dripping with the words of interposition and nullification—one
day right there in Alabama, little black boys and black girls will be able to join hands with
little white boys and white girls as sisters and brothers.
I have a dream today!
I have a dream that one day every valley shall be exalted, and every hill and
mountain shall be made low. The rough places will be plain and the crooked places will
be made straight, “and the glory of the Lord shall be revealed, and all flesh shall see it
together.”
This is our hope. This is the faith that I go back to the South with. With this faith
we will be able to hew out of the mountain of despair a stone of hope. With this faith we
will be able to transform the jangling discords of our nation into a beautiful symphony of
brotherhood. With this faith we will be able to work together, to pray together, to struggle
together, to go to jail together, to stand up for freedom together, knowing that we will be
free one day. And this will be the day. This will be the day when all of God’s children will
be able to sing with new meaning, “My country ’tis of thee, sweet land of liberty, of thee I
sing. Land where my fathers died, land of the pilgrims’ pride, from every mountainside,
let freedom ring.” And if America is to be a great nation, this must become true.
So let freedom ring from the prodigious hilltops of New Hampshire, let freedom
ring from the mighty mountains of New York; let freedom ring from the heightening
Alleghenies of Pennsylvania; let freedom ring from the snow-capped Rockies of
Colorado; let freedom ring from the curvaceous slopes of California. But not only that.
Let freedom ring from Stone Mountain of Georgia; let freedom ring from Lookout
Mountain of Tennessee; let freedom ring from every hill and molehill of Mississippi.
“From every mountainside, let freedom ring.”
And when this happens, and when we allow freedom to ring, when we let it ring
from every village and every hamlet, from every state and every city, we will be able to
speed up that day when all of God’s children—black men and white men, Jews and
Gentiles, Protestants and Catholics—will be able to join hands and sing in the words of
the old Negro spiritual, “Free at last. Free at last. Thank God Almighty, we are free at
last.”

                        <p>Answer:</p><p></p><p>Explanation:</p><p>Skip to content</p><p>Song Meanings and Facts</p><p>MASKED WOLF</p><p>“Astronaut in the Ocean” by Masked Wolf</p><p>BY AMANDA LONDON · PUBLISHED MARCH 3, 2021 · UPDATED MARCH 3, 2021</p><p></p><p>As implied in this post’s tail end, up until the release of “Astronaut in the Ocean”, Masked Wolf wasn’t necessarily a successful musician. That may explain why, according to his own words, he was dealing with a severe case of mental depression when he put this song together. That being said, it is important to mention that mental health has also been his signature topic.</p><p></p><p>Track "Masked Wolf"</p><p>on Bandsintown</p><p>And accordingly what we were dealing with in terms of the title is an analogy. The way it has been described is as being based on the fact that astronauts tend to train for being in space by performing similar tasks underwater. And metaphorically, the artist’s depression is also “deep” like the depths of the sea. </p><p></p><p>So that is why he “feel(s) like an astronaut in the ocean”, with the astronaut being himself, and the ocean being symbolic of the overall, encompassing anguish he is experiencing.</p><p></p><p>Lyrics of "Astronaut in the Ocean"</p><p>And as alluded to earlier, he does sort of imply in the first verse that such may be due to his career not progressing as idealized. But harping too much on the depressing aspect of this song takes away from its conclusive meaning. For as far as the actual verses are concerned, “Astronaut in the Ocean” isn’t so much about the artist being overwhelmed by his problems as it is his resolve to overcome them. In fact as things progress the lyrics themselves become more braggadocious in nature.</p><p></p><p></p><p> </p><p>Indeed in many regards the Masked Wolf comes off as your quintessential rapper. For instance, he presents himself as somewhat of a womanizer and an artist with exceptional lyrical skills. But there is a humble, even semi-religious tone underneath it all. </p><p></p><p>Conclusion</p><p>So conclusively we can say that yes, the vocalist at hand may at times feel overwhelmed by the weight of the world. But he possesses a type of faith and work ethic which will not allow him to actually be overcome by such.</p><p></p><p>Release Date of “Astronaut in the Ocean”</p><p>Masked Wolf is a rapper from Australia who became professionally active in 2018. And heading into 2021 Astronaut in the Ocean, which came out on 6 June 2019, remains his most-famous (and only chart-worthy) song.</p><p></p><p>This track was originally released under a label called Teamwrk Records. But after blowing up on social media, Elektra Records re-released it in early-January 2021. In the process, Elektra also signed Masked Wolf to a multi-album contract. However, he still remains affiliated with Teamwrk. And the following month, the song proceeded to exceed 100,000,000 streams on Spotify.</p><p></p><p></p><p> </p><p>Even More Accomplishments</p><p>This track topped music charts in the Czech Republic and Slovakia. It actually proved to be especially popular in Europe, where it charted in a slew of countries. It charted in approximately 20 nations overall. This included “Astronaut in the Ocean” making an appearance on the Billboard Hot 100 and UK Singles Chart. In the latter case, it broke the top 20.</p><p></p><p>Writing and Production</p><p>Masked Wolf wrote this song alongside its producer, Tyron Hapi, another Sydney-based musician. It didn’t blow up until a year after being released, with the intro in particular being heavily utilized by TikTokers. And overall, it appears as if the success of this track may prove to shed a whole new light on hip-hop emanating from Australia in general.</p><p></p><p>It has also been noted that NFL quarterback Patrick Mahomes, who used the song on an Instagram post, contributed to its virality.</p><p></p><p>Who is Masked Wolf?</p><p>As of early-2021 not much public information is available on Masked Wolf. He is 29 years old at the time, and based on images of the rapper he doesn’t necessarily appear to be a native (i.e. White) Australian. He rather looks like someone who is perhaps of Middle Eastern descent. </p><p></p><p></p><p> </p><p>Meanwhile the name Masked Wolf alludes to the dual-nature of the artist. What this basically means is that he is (based on his own words) someone “you wouldn’t even think [is] a rapper” outside of the studio.</p><p></p><p></p><p>Masked Wolf gives a shoutout to Kendrick Lamar and his 2012 track “Swimming Pools (Drank)” in this song.</p><br />

                            8. My father's boss is a peculiar man. On one occasion, the employees heard their boss's telephone ring. It reag several times but no one answered it. It seemed as if no one was there. Someone opened the door to his office. There, inside, the employee the ringing telephone. “Sir , the telephone, please. “Yes, yes," and he walked to the door as if someone were waiting outside for him. “No, sir. I mean the telephone." “What? Oh, yes, I was about to answer it, but I was thinking of the accounts you gave me, I'm afraid that I have lost them.” The papers comprising the statement of accounts were in his hand.

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>1. The single incident that is the focus of the story is when the employees heard their boss's telephone ringing but found out that he had it with him in his office and was unaware of it.</p><p></p><p>2. The observation by the author that reinforces this incident is the boss's absent-mindedness, which is highlighted by the fact that he had the telephone with him but did not realize it was ringing.</p><p></p><p>3. This incident brings out a general truth about human beings, which is that we can sometimes become so absorbed in our thoughts and tasks that we become unaware of our surroundings. This can result in absent-mindedness and forgetfulness, as demonstrated by the boss in the story.

                            15. Read the story carefully and do the tasks that follow.WHY DOGS WAG THEIR TAILS(Excerpt: First of Two Parts)(An Adaptation)(1) Once upon a time in a faraway land there lived a rich man who had a pet dog andcat. His only daughter whom he adored so much was living in a place several miles away fromhim. It was his custom to send his dog and cat to her daughter and bring her a present. Thedog was a bit old and had pretty much lost some teeth so he was no longer able to fight. But, healways knew how to find the way. The cat on the other hand was strong and shrewd so theycould help the other.(2) One day the rich man wanted to send a magic ring to his daughter. He called the dobgand cat. He said to the cat " You have shown a lot of character such as being shrewd andprudent so you may carry this magic ring to my daughter but you have to make sure to takegreat care of it." He also said to the dog You are to go with the cat to take this magic ring to mydaughter. Take care not to lose the way and be sure that no one bothers the cat'. Both animalspromised to do their best and went on their way.(3) On the way, they were impelled to cross a wide and deep river. They weredetermined to swim across as there was no bridge and they couldn't find a boat. The dog said tothe cat, "You need to hand me the ring;" "Oh no!", replied the cat. "Did you not remember whatthe master said just what each of us had to do?", "Yes, but you are not very good at swimmingso I can better take good care of it." The cat refused to disobey the master until the dogthreatened to kill the cat. He was left with no choice but to hand over the magic ring.(4) They began swimming but the current was so strong. It took them an hour in gettingover so they were both tired and weak. Just as they were about to come to the other side, thedog accidentally dropped the ring into the water and finding it seems impossible. The cat saidNow, we have to go back home and tell our master that we lost the ring". "Yes" answered thedog, "but I am scared". So they went back home. As they drew near the house the dog's fearOverpowered him that he ran away as fast as he could and was never seen again.(5) The master, surprised to see the cat back so soon, asked " Why are you alone?".The cat was a bit scared to answer at first. Where is the dog?" asked the master again, "Oh! Heran away' replied the cat. "Ran away?" said the master, "What do you mean? "Where is thering? Let me tell you what happened but please do not get angry"(5) When we reached the river bank, the doq asked me to hand him the ring, I refused alot of times but he threatened to kill me so I was left with no choice. The current was so strongand we were having a hard time crossing the river; so, on the way the dog dropped the ring andwe couldn't find it anymore"T told the dog to go back and tell you what happened, but he said he was so scaredthat he ran away as fast as he could".(8) With this, the master made a proclamation that whoever finds his old dog and canbring him back will be rewarded. The dog'can easily Be recognized às he was already old andhas no teeth. The master had also declared that the dog will be punished by cutting off his tail.(9) It was ordered that all the dogs shall take part in the search. Eversince, that time,when one dog meets another, he always says, "Are you the old dog who lost the ring?". If youwere that dog, your tail will be cut off. Then both the dogs show their teeth and wag their tailswhich means no. It was also that time when cats have been afraid of water.​</h2><br />

                            28. I say to you today, my friends, even though we face the difficulties of today and
tomorrow, I still have a dream. It is a dream deeply rooted in the American dream. I
have a dream that one day this nation will rise up and live out the true meaning of its
creed, “We hold these truths to be self-evident; that all men are created equal.” I have a
dream that one day on the red hills of Georgia, sons of former slaves and the sons of
former slave owners will be able to sit down together at the table of brotherhood. I have
a dream that one day even the state of Mississippi, a state sweltering with the heat of
injustice, sweltering with the heat of oppression, will be transformed into an oasis of
freedom and justice. I have a dream that my four little children will one day live in a
nation where they will not be judged by the color of their skin, but by the content of their
character.
I have a dream today!
I have a dream that one day down in Alabama—with its vicious racists, with its
Governor having his lips dripping with the words of interposition and nullification—one
day right there in Alabama, little black boys and black girls will be able to join hands with
little white boys and white girls as sisters and brothers.
I have a dream today!
I have a dream that one day every valley shall be exalted, and every hill and
mountain shall be made low. The rough places will be plain and the crooked places will
be made straight, “and the glory of the Lord shall be revealed, and all flesh shall see it
together.”
This is our hope. This is the faith that I go back to the South with. With this faith
we will be able to hew out of the mountain of despair a stone of hope. With this faith we
will be able to transform the jangling discords of our nation into a beautiful symphony of
brotherhood. With this faith we will be able to work together, to pray together, to struggle
together, to go to jail together, to stand up for freedom together, knowing that we will be
free one day. And this will be the day. This will be the day when all of God’s children will
be able to sing with new meaning, “My country ’tis of thee, sweet land of liberty, of thee I
sing. Land where my fathers died, land of the pilgrims’ pride, from every mountainside,
let freedom ring.” And if America is to be a great nation, this must become true.
So let freedom ring from the prodigious hilltops of New Hampshire, let freedom
ring from the mighty mountains of New York; let freedom ring from the heightening
Alleghenies of Pennsylvania; let freedom ring from the snow-capped Rockies of
Colorado; let freedom ring from the curvaceous slopes of California. But not only that.
Let freedom ring from Stone Mountain of Georgia; let freedom ring from Lookout
Mountain of Tennessee; let freedom ring from every hill and molehill of Mississippi.
“From every mountainside, let freedom ring.”
And when this happens, and when we allow freedom to ring, when we let it ring
from every village and every hamlet, from every state and every city, we will be able to
speed up that day when all of God’s children—black men and white men, Jews and
Gentiles, Protestants and Catholics—will be able to join hands and sing in the words of
the old Negro spiritual, “Free at last. Free at last. Thank God Almighty, we are free at
last.”
