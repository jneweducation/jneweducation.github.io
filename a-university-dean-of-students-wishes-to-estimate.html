A student is revising a story for the school newspaper that includes the following quote:
"The university is merely responding to the public health threat caused by consuming large amounts of soft drinks," Dean Robert Strickler said. "We demand that consumption of such drinks occur only off campus."
What word could the dean have used in place of demand to make his quote less angry and insistent? 
Command
Dictate
Recommend
Require</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p>Recommend <p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>Recommend is much more respectful in a way where the dean isn't "going against."</p><p>What I mean is the words Command, Dictate, and Require give a stronger sense of power.</p><p>When a teacher tells you, "I <strong>command </strong>that you use a harder word," it sounds angry and insistent even if it wasn't meant to.</p><p>"I <strong>recommend </strong>that you use a harder word," sounds less angry and less insistent.</p><p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Require</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>Command is still very angry and insistent, " I command you to go do your homework! " Dictate doesn't really make sense, and recommend is a recommendation, which means you don't have to do it. " I recommend you try the strawberry soda!

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>As a member of the advisory board, I would suggest the following redesigns to increase communication and collaboration across departments, and improve curriculum integration for students in all areas of study:</p><p></p><p>1. Cross-functional teams: Encourage the creation of cross-functional teams that bring together faculty members from different departments to work on common projects or initiatives. This will help break down silos between departments and encourage collaboration.</p><p></p><p>2. Interdisciplinary courses: Develop interdisciplinary courses that require students from different departments to work together on projects or case studies. This will help students see the connections between different business functions and develop a more holistic view of the business world.</p><p></p><p>3. Shared teaching and research spaces: Encourage the creation of shared teaching and research spaces that can be used by faculty members from different departments. This will facilitate informal communication and collaboration between faculty members.</p><p></p><p>4. Joint faculty appointments: Consider joint faculty appointments between departments. This will help break down departmental barriers and encourage collaboration between faculty members.</p><p></p><p>5. Curriculum integration: Work to integrate the curriculum across different departments. For example, accounting courses could include more information on marketing or management, and marketing courses could include more information on finance or accounting. This will help students develop a more well-rounded understanding of business.</p><p></p><p>By implementing these redesigns, the business school can encourage greater collaboration between departments, and provide students with a more integrated and well-rounded business education.</p><br />

Estimate the population proportion of students that 11% will take the summer class. Use the 95% confidence level. (Answer :2.For a class project, a grade 11 student in a public school want to estimate the percentage of students who are registered voters. He survey 500 students and finds that 300 are registered voters. Compute a 90 confidence interval for the true percentage of students who are registered voters.lAnswer:​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p><strong>How do you find the 95 confidence interval for the population proportion?</strong></p><p>Suppose you take a random sample of 100 different trips through this intersection and you find that a red light was hit 53 times. Because you want a 95 percent confidence interval, your z*-value is 1.96. The red light was hit 53 out of 100 times. So<strong> ρ = 53/100 = 0.53.</strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong>How do you find the sample size with a population proportion?</strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong>X = Zα/22 *p*(1-p) / MOE2</strong><strong>,</strong> and Zα/2 is the critical value of the Normal distribution at α/2 (e.g. for a confidence level of 95%, α is 0.05 and the critical value is 1.96), MOE is the margin of error, p is the sample proportion, and N is the population size.</p><p><strong></strong></p><p>What is the z-score for 95% confidence interval?</p><p></p><p><strong>-1.96</strong></p><p>The critical z-score values when using a 95 percent confidence level are <strong>-1.96 and +1.96 standard deviations.</strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong>41 A Confidence Interval for A Population Proportion</strong></p><p>During an election year, we see articles in the newspaper that state confidence intervals in terms of proportions or percentages. For example, a poll for a particular candidate running for president might show that the candidate has 40% of the vote within three percentage points (if the sample is large enough). Often, election polls are calculated with 95% confidence, so, the pollsters would be 95% confident that the true proportion of voters who favored the candidate would be between 0.37 and 0.43.</p><p></p><p>Investors in the stock market are interested in the true proportion of stocks that go up and down each week. Businesses that sell personal computers are interested in the proportion of households in the United States that own personal computers. Confidence intervals can be calculated for the true proportion of stocks that go up or down each week and for the true proportion of households in the United States that own personal computers.</p><p></p><p>The procedure to find the confidence interval for a population proportion is similar to that for the population mean, but the formulas are a bit different although conceptually identical. While the formulas are different, they are based upon the same mathematical foundation given to us by the Central Limit Theorem. Because of this we will see the same basic format using the same three pieces of information: the sample value of the parameter in question, the standard deviation of the relevant sampling distribution, and the number of standard deviations we need to have the confidence in our estimate that we desire.</p><p></p><p>How do you know you are dealing with a proportion problem? First, the underlying distribution has a binary random variable and therefore is a binomial distribution. (There is no mention of a mean or average.) If X is a binomial random variable, then X ~ B(n, p) where n is the number of trials and p is the probability of a success. To form a sample proportion, take X, the random variable for the number of successes and divide it by n, the number of trials (or the sample size). The random variable P′ (read “P prime”) is the sample proportion,</p><p><strong></strong></p><p>(P1 = X / N)</p><p></p><p></p><br />
