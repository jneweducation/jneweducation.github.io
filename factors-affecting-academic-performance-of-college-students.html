Nowadays, this can be a person's most efficient strategic tool for enabling himself to take charge and cope with the fast growing technology.</p><p>The fact that people live in on informative lifestyle where everything is updated, internet became one of the necessities of human beings regardless of age or sex in today's society. However, the influence of this useful machine on youth is undeniably questionable. As to what Rock [1] said, all these technologies are very good at distracting people. In line with this development, online gaming was created to give entertainment to people.</p><p>Online gaming is one of the widely used leisure activities by many people. For some people it is said that playing video games has a number of reasons to be played, for it can be a stress reliever, challenge and competition, relaxation, enjoyment, social interaction, and even mentally escaping from the real world.</p><p>For most people, on-line gaming is one of the best past time that they acquire specially for teenagers, youngsters and students. According to Kuss &amp; Griffiths [2], teens who play online games are just having fun. They do not just actually play because of some sort of seriousness, but also because they just want to feel relief. During school hours, students tend to feel stressed due to loads of school works and through playing it will relive their stress.</p><p>It is undeniably questionable that playing online games provide them something that no one can give. According to some researches it is beneficial. It enables the mind of the players to be more active, especially those puzzle-based games. Furthermore, it helps the player to come up with decisions in tight situations, especially those adventure games that keep the players to be alert, active and strategic.</p><p>Students' learning takes place unexpectedly, but the inappropriate usage of playing online games also leads in some problems such as being distracted in school. Further, it is where the attention of the child were divided that even their health and social life is unknowingly affected.</p><p>Several studies in psychology have found out that increased time spent on the Internet can lead to negative impact on a person's ability to communicate appropriately face-to-face with friends, peers, family members including parents [3].</p><p>Studies revealed that the human brain is easy to destruct and one of the reasons is using technology. The education system tends to go with the flow with this constant change in the society in order to get things relevant with the generations today.</p><p>The researchers felt the need to determine the impact of online gaming to students' academic performance and their social behavior. The purpose of this study is to find out the implications of on-line gaming to the academic performance and social behavior of the students.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>bala ka jan.</p><p></p><br />
