Tornados and Hurricanes Hurricanes and tornados are both amazing yet deadly natural phenomena. Both generate deadly conditions, but in different ways Tornados are likely to damage people and property with their high winds, which go up to 300 miles per hour, but hurricanes are generally more feared for their flooding Also hurricanes can produce tornados, which makes them quite dangerous indeed 2. Where Did This Tornado Come From? No one knows exactly what causes tornados, but some scientists believe that when warm air meets cold air, a tornado may form. The reason for this is that the warm air is lighter than the cold air, so it rises up fast and meets different winds moving different directions Under the right conditions, this can cause a tornado. Though there is still much mystery surrounding tornados, many people believe that when warm moist air meets cool dry air, tornados can result 3. Twista Carl Terrell Mitchell, better known by his stage name Twista, was born in 1972 Nineteen years later Mitchell's first album, "Runnin' Off at da Mouth." debuted in 1997, after appearing on a hit song. Twista was signed to Atlantic Records Under that label he released Adrenaime Rush" and formed the group Speedknot Monsta in 1998 His 2004 album Kamikaze went to number-one on the US Billboard 200 album chart 4. The Twist The twist is a dance inspired by rock and roll music To do the Twist, first stand with your feet approximately shoulder width apart. The torso may be squared to the knees and hips, or turned at an angie so one foot is farther forward than the other Then hold your arms out from your body, bent at your elbow Next, rotate your hips, torso, and legs as a single unit with your arms staying more or less stationary Every so often lift one leg off of the floor for styling Now you're doing the twist! 5. Dancing There are many reasons why people dance Some people dance for fun, just because they enjoy dancing At other times, people dance for exercise or for weight loss, because dancing can really get your heart beating Also, sometimes people dance to try to get boyfriends or girlfriends. Some people think that good dancing is attractive. There are many reasons why people dance​</a>

                                            TRUE or FALSE1. The Geologic Time Scale (GTS) is an arbitrary chronological arrangement orsequence of geologic events2. The geologic time scale is used as a measure of the relative or absoluteduration or age of any part of geologic time.3. The geologic time is usually presented in the form of a chart showing the namesof the various rock-stratigraphic, time-stratigraphic, or geologic-time units.4. The table of geologic time spans agrees primarily with the nomenclature, dalesand standard color codes as set forth by the International Commission onStratification.5. Relative dating is an important tool used to portray the history of the Earth.6. Absolute dating provides the exact age of our planet.7. Igneous rocks are the best types of rock samples to use for radiometric dating8. The geologic time scale is divided into eons, eras, and periods9. The Earth is very new, and the study of Earth's past requires us to think abouttimes that were millions or even billions of years ago.10. The age of the Earth is 13.8 billion years.11. Scientists use the geologic time to illustrate the order in which events on Earthhave happened.12. The Earth's entire history is separated into four principal divisions namelyHadeon, Archean, Proterozoic, and Phanerozoic.13. The generally accepted divisions of the geologic time from the smallest to themost encompassing are eon, era, period, epoch, age.14. Humans appeared during the quarternary period.15. Geologist make use of information derived from marker fossils to define andidentify subdivisions of geologic time scale.​</a>

                                            pa help plsCase Study: Solar Cell ManufacturerSolar Cell is a manufacturing company based in southern part of Korea that manufactures different types of solar-powered products. They have customers based in the local parts of the country and abroad. The company is growing fast due to the increased demand for non-conventional energy. The CEO of the company associates their success in the use of control charts for their manufacturing procedures which lets them control the quality of their final outputs.Although the company has been quite successful in the use of control charts for their manufacturing operations, it has extended the applications of control charts in their non-manufacturing sectors such as HR and Finance. The reason for this implementation is because of the majorincrease in employee attrition and significantly large budget allotted to several departments of the company. Based on the result of the exit interviews, most of the employees who left the company claimed that they experienced work-life imbalance particularly for the operators since they were required to work in extended hours in circumstances when their substitute partners would not be able to arrive to work on time or would not be able to report to work at all. The minority of the resigned employees thought that they were misaligned and not trained for their job, they felt undervalued and afraid that growth opportunities were not present in the company. Another problem area that the top management has observed involves the finance team of the company. The management have found out that allotted budgets in some departments or work units of the firm are unrealistic, inaccurate, and unreasonable. After reviewing all the problem areas of the organization, the company’s quality assurance team suggested the use of control charts in the two (2) departments where the problems are prevalent.However, another difficult situation arises due to the resistance of the employees toward the use of control charts which gains several complaints from the employees pertaining to exhausting additional workload since they would have to monitor and notate the different outflows and inflows in their major and minor day-to-day operations. There was a clear lack of understanding of the benefits of control charts and the need for change using control charts as a catalyst for change. The senior management team decided to provide a one-day awareness program for the HR and Finance people so that they can understand the expectations and the need for the control chart initiative within the company. Moreover, an executive awareness was also introduced to all senior management team so that they would understand the importance and benefits of control charts in the business.​Follow the suggested outline below in answering the case study:
I. Background
a. It must include a brief summary of the organizational issue. 
II. Statement of the Problem
a. How can Solar Cell Manufacturer control or eliminate attrition and overspending in their 
organization through the use of control charts? 
b. What steps should the top management employ in order to overcome the resistance of

They also exhibit charac- ristic features such as frequency ampliade, wavelength. period and we speed. The alternate pushing and pulling mechanically exerts force on unit areas of air particles and thus creating pressure waves. This alternating compressions and rarefaction make up the longitudinal reves ke sound waves. The speed of sound many differ for datterent types of solids, liquids and gas- For one, the elastic properties are different for different materials. Thus, sound can travel faster in mednams with higher elastic properties than in lower elastic properties. Another, the band strength between particles also affects the speed of sound. Thes, sound waves travel faster in solids than in liquids and fast- er in liquids than in gases. While the density of a medium also affects the speed of sound, the elastic properties have a greater influence on wave speed. Another thing, the speed of sound is directly affected by the temperature of the medium Temperature is also a condition that affects the speed of sound. - Mele- cules at higher temperatures have more energy. thus they can vibrate faster. Since the molecules vibrate faster, sound waves can travel more quickly. The speed of sound in room temperature air is 346 meters per second. The speed of sound is the distance travelled per unit time by a sound wave as it propagates through an elastic medium. The speed of sound in eir is about 343 metres per second (1,235 km/h at 20 °C (68 °F). : 1.125 ft/s: 767 mph; 667 km), or a lometre in 2.9 s or a mile in 4.7 s. It depends strongly on temperature as well as the medium through which a sound wave is propagat- Given normal atmospheric conditions, the temperature, and thus speed of sound, varies with altitude.

                                            TRUE or FALSE1. The Geologic Time Scale (GTS) is an arbitrary chronological arrangement orsequence of geologic events2. The geologic time scale is used as a measure of the relative or absoluteduration or age of any part of geologic time.3. The geologic time is usually presented in the form of a chart showing the namesof the various rock-stratigraphic, time-stratigraphic, or geologic-time units.4. The table of geologic time spans agrees primarily with the nomenclature, dalesand standard color codes as set forth by the International Commission onStratification.5. Relative dating is an important tool used to portray the history of the Earth.6. Absolute dating provides the exact age of our planet.7. Igneous rocks are the best types of rock samples to use for radiometric dating8. The geologic time scale is divided into eons, eras, and periods9. The Earth is very new, and the study of Earth's past requires us to think abouttimes that were millions or even billions of years ago.10. The age of the Earth is 13.8 billion years.11. Scientists use the geologic time to illustrate the order in which events on Earthhave happened.12. The Earth's entire history is separated into four principal divisions namelyHadeon, Archean, Proterozoic, and Phanerozoic.13. The generally accepted divisions of the geologic time from the smallest to themost encompassing are eon, era, period, epoch, age.14. Humans appeared during the quarternary period.15. Geologist make use of information derived from marker fossils to define andidentify subdivisions of geologic time scale.​</a>

Tornados and Hurricanes Hurricanes and tornados are both amazing yet deadly natural phenomena. Both generate deadly conditions, but in different ways Tornados are likely to damage people and property with their high winds, which go up to 300 miles per hour, but hurricanes are generally more feared for their flooding Also hurricanes can produce tornados, which makes them quite dangerous indeed 2. Where Did This Tornado Come From? No one knows exactly what causes tornados, but some scientists believe that when warm air meets cold air, a tornado may form. The reason for this is that the warm air is lighter than the cold air, so it rises up fast and meets different winds moving different directions Under the right conditions, this can cause a tornado. Though there is still much mystery surrounding tornados, many people believe that when warm moist air meets cool dry air, tornados can result 3. Twista Carl Terrell Mitchell, better known by his stage name Twista, was born in 1972 Nineteen years later Mitchell's first album, "Runnin' Off at da Mouth." debuted in 1997, after appearing on a hit song. Twista was signed to Atlantic Records Under that label he released Adrenaime Rush" and formed the group Speedknot Monsta in 1998 His 2004 album Kamikaze went to number-one on the US Billboard 200 album chart 4. The Twist The twist is a dance inspired by rock and roll music To do the Twist, first stand with your feet approximately shoulder width apart. The torso may be squared to the knees and hips, or turned at an angie so one foot is farther forward than the other Then hold your arms out from your body, bent at your elbow Next, rotate your hips, torso, and legs as a single unit with your arms staying more or less stationary Every so often lift one leg off of the floor for styling Now you're doing the twist! 5. Dancing There are many reasons why people dance Some people dance for fun, just because they enjoy dancing At other times, people dance for exercise or for weight loss, because dancing can really get your heart beating Also, sometimes people dance to try to get boyfriends or girlfriends. Some people think that good dancing is attractive. There are many reasons why people dance​</h2><br />

                            12. TRUE or FALSE1. The Geologic Time Scale (GTS) is an arbitrary chronological arrangement orsequence of geologic events2. The geologic time scale is used as a measure of the relative or absoluteduration or age of any part of geologic time.3. The geologic time is usually presented in the form of a chart showing the namesof the various rock-stratigraphic, time-stratigraphic, or geologic-time units.4. The table of geologic time spans agrees primarily with the nomenclature, dalesand standard color codes as set forth by the International Commission onStratification.5. Relative dating is an important tool used to portray the history of the Earth.6. Absolute dating provides the exact age of our planet.7. Igneous rocks are the best types of rock samples to use for radiometric dating8. The geologic time scale is divided into eons, eras, and periods9. The Earth is very new, and the study of Earth's past requires us to think abouttimes that were millions or even billions of years ago.10. The age of the Earth is 13.8 billion years.11. Scientists use the geologic time to illustrate the order in which events on Earthhave happened.12. The Earth's entire history is separated into four principal divisions namelyHadeon, Archean, Proterozoic, and Phanerozoic.13. The generally accepted divisions of the geologic time from the smallest to themost encompassing are eon, era, period, epoch, age.14. Humans appeared during the quarternary period.15.

                            15. pa help plsCase Study: Solar Cell ManufacturerSolar Cell is a manufacturing company based in southern part of Korea that manufactures different types of solar-powered products. They have customers based in the local parts of the country and abroad. The company is growing fast due to the increased demand for non-conventional energy. The CEO of the company associates their success in the use of control charts for their manufacturing procedures which lets them control the quality of their final outputs.Although the company has been quite successful in the use of control charts for their manufacturing operations, it has extended the applications of control charts in their non-manufacturing sectors such as HR and Finance. The reason for this implementation is because of the majorincrease in employee attrition and significantly large budget allotted to several departments of the company. Based on the result of the exit interviews, most of the employees who left the company claimed that they experienced work-life imbalance particularly for the operators since they were required to work in extended hours in circumstances when their substitute partners would not be able to arrive to work on time or would not be able to report to work at all. The minority of the resigned employees thought that they were misaligned and not trained for their job, they felt undervalued and afraid that growth opportunities were not present in the company. Another problem area that the top management has observed involves the finance team of the company. The management have found out that allotted budgets in some departments or work units of the firm are unrealistic, inaccurate, and unreasonable. After reviewing all the problem areas of the organization, the company’s quality assurance team suggested the use of control charts in the two (2) departments where the problems are prevalent.However, another difficult situation arises due to the resistance of the employees toward the use of control charts which gains several complaints from the employees pertaining to exhausting additional workload since they would have to monitor and notate the different outflows and inflows in their major and minor day-to-day operations. There was a clear lack of understanding of the benefits of control charts and the need for change using control charts as a catalyst for change. The senior management team decided to provide a one-day awareness program for the HR and Finance people so that they can understand the expectations and the need for the control chart initiative within the company. Moreover, an executive awareness was also introduced to all senior management team so that they would understand the importance and benefits of control charts in the business.​Follow the suggested outline below in answering the case study:

They also exhibit charac- ristic features such as frequency ampliade, wavelength. period and we speed. The alternate pushing and pulling mechanically exerts force on unit areas of air particles and thus creating pressure waves. This alternating compressions and rarefaction make up the longitudinal reves ke sound waves. The speed of sound many differ for datterent types of solids, liquids and gas- For one, the elastic properties are different for different materials. Thus, sound can travel faster in mednams with higher elastic properties than in lower elastic properties. Another, the band strength between particles also affects the speed of sound. Thes, sound waves travel faster in solids than in liquids and fast- er in liquids than in gases. While the density of a medium also affects the speed of sound, the elastic properties have a greater influence on wave speed. Another thing, the speed of sound is directly affected by the temperature of the medium Temperature is also a condition that affects the speed of sound. - Mele- cules at higher temperatures have more energy. thus they can vibrate faster. Since the molecules vibrate faster, sound waves can travel more quickly. The speed of sound in room temperature air is 346 meters per second. The speed of sound is the distance travelled per unit time by a sound wave as it propagates through an elastic medium. The speed of sound in eir is about 343 metres per second (1,235 km/h at 20 °C (68 °F). : 1.125 ft/s: 767 mph; 667 km), or a lometre in 2.9 s or a mile in 4.7 s. It depends strongly on temperature as well as the medium through which a sound wave is propagat- Given normal atmospheric conditions, the temperature, and thus speed of sound, varies with altitude.

                            24. TRUE or FALSE1. The Geologic Time Scale (GTS) is an arbitrary chronological arrangement orsequence of geologic events2. The geologic time scale is used as a measure of the relative or absoluteduration or age of any part of geologic time.3. The geologic time is usually presented in the form of a chart showing the namesof the various rock-stratigraphic, time-stratigraphic, or geologic-time units.4. The table of geologic time spans agrees primarily with the nomenclature, dalesand standard color codes as set forth by the International Commission onStratification.5. Relative dating is an important tool used to portray the history of the Earth.6. Absolute dating provides the exact age of our planet.7. Igneous rocks are the best types of rock samples to use for radiometric dating8. The geologic time scale is divided into eons, eras, and periods9. The Earth is very new, and the study of Earth's past requires us to think abouttimes that were millions or even billions of years ago.10. The age of the Earth is 13.8 billion years.11. Scientists use the geologic time to illustrate the order in which events on Earthhave happened.12. The Earth's entire history is separated into four principal divisions namelyHadeon, Archean, Proterozoic, and Phanerozoic.13. The generally accepted divisions of the geologic time from the smallest to themost encompassing are eon, era, period, epoch, age.14. Humans appeared during the quarternary period.15.
