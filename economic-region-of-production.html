ASIA'S NATURAL RESOURCES GETTING STRAINED BY DEVELOPMENT -MAVVELIN U. CARBALLO THE MANILA TIMES(JUNE 07.2012) Asia Pacific countries must maintain their natural capital such as forests, biodiversity, freshwater, and coastal and marine ecosystems to achieve o green economy, according to a joint report by the Asian Development Bank(ADB) and Worldwide Fund for Nature (WWF). The report entitled "Ecological Footprint and Investment in Natural Capital in Asia and the Pacific" said that the Asia Pacific region is consuming more resources than its ecosystems can sustain, threatening the future of the region's beleaguered forests, rivers, and oceans as well as the livelihoods of those who depend on them. In the past two decades, the report noted that the state of ecosystems in the region has been declining because of the activities such as conversion of primary forests to agricultural land or monoculture plantations; extensive coastal developments and unsustainable exploitation of marine resources; and conversion of freshwater ecosystem for agricultural use. The joint ADB-WWF study, looks in more detail at the state of erosystems in Asia-Pacific and what can be done to sustain them. It focuses on ways of preserving key large-scale regional ecosystems, including the forests of Borneo, the marine wealth of the Coral Triangle, the Mekong region's diverse habitats, and the mountainous Eastern Himalayas. These areas contain some of the region's most important natural resources on which millions of people depend for their sustenance and development. Nessim Ahmad, ADB director for Environment and Safeguards, said that major ecosystems such as the Coral Triangle and the heart of the Borneo rainforest are vital to the future of Asia Pacific "We need large scale programmutir efforts based on regional cooperation and local level action to make sure they are sustained for future generations," Ahmad added. Per capita drops Moreover, the report explained that by 2008, the per capita natural resources in these regional ecosystems had shrunk by about two-thirds compared to 1970. Despite the rich natural capital in the region, the report noted that bio-diversity is in decline in all types of ecosystems, with the rate of species loss about twice the global average. The report used the Living Planet Index - one of the more widely used indicators for tracking the state of biodiversity around the world - to measure changes in the health of ecosystems across the Asia-Pacific. The global index fell by about 30 percent between 1970 and 2008, while the Indo Pacific region shows an even greater decline of 64 per-cent in key populations of species during the same period. Across the region, the gap between the ecological footprint, or human demand for natural resources, and the environment's ability to replenish those resources is widening, it added. The report also said that the challenge for countries of Asia Pacific is to manage their natural sustainability, so that they maintain ecosystems services such as food, water, timber, pollination of crops and absorption of human waste products like carbon dioxide, to attain long-term development. "We need to create mechanisms that make protecting our resources the right economic choice for the communities that use and depend on them," said WWI Director General Jim Leape, livesting in the region's resources pays. It is estimated that every dollar spent on conservation efforts would yield an economic and social value of ecosystems worth over $100, it added. On the other hand, ADB said that it places environmentally sustainable growth at the core of its work to help seduce poverty in the region. It approved a record 59 projects supporting environmental sustainability in 2011, which amounted to about $7 billion in financing.GABAY NA TAYAHIN 2 GAWAIN 8: Sagutain ang mga sumusunod na pamprosesong tanong.

Do this on a separate sheet of paper. The Islands of Paradise By: Richard Gula The Philippines is a sovereign state in archipelagic Southeast Asia and is home to an amazing collection of over 7,640 islands spanning more than 300,000 square kilometers of territory. These islands are divided into three regions namely Luzon, Visayas, and Mindanao Luzon is the largest and the most populous island in the Philippines which is considered the 15th largest island in the world. It is the nation's center for economy and politics, being home to the country's big factories and government's national offices including the Malacañang Palace. It is also the home of mountainous terrains, picturesque volcanoes, numerous lakes, rivers, and plains. Visayas is the smallest region in terms of land area in the central part of the archipelago. It is the home to major Philippine religious and cultural festivals such as Ati-atihan, Dinagyang, Sinulog, Pintados, and Masskara. It is also known for its famous landmarks such as the Chocolate Hills of Bohol, San Juanico Bridge of Leyte, and the island of Boracay. Mindanao is the second largest among the three islands in the southernmost part of the Philippines. It is the main contributor to the country's Gross Domestic Product (GDP) in terms of agriculture, fishing, forestry, etc. Mindanao is known to be the home of the Philippine eagle and the "king of the fruits" which is the durian. All three islands are defined by their unique location, culture, and custom. The Philippines is indeed a paradise in its true sense. Guide Questions: 1. How many islands are found in the Philippines? 2. What are the three island groups in the Philippines? 3. What makes Luzon the economic and political center of the country? 4. What makes the Visayas unique from Luzon and Mindanao? Summary:​</a>

ASIA'S NATURAL RESOURCES GETTING STRAINED BY DEVELOPMENT -MAVVELIN U. CARBALLO THE MANILA TIMES(JUNE 07.2012) Asia Pacific countries must maintain their natural capital such as forests, biodiversity, freshwater, and coastal and marine ecosystems to achieve o green economy, according to a joint report by the Asian Development Bank(ADB) and Worldwide Fund for Nature (WWF). The report entitled "Ecological Footprint and Investment in Natural Capital in Asia and the Pacific" said that the Asia Pacific region is consuming more resources than its ecosystems can sustain, threatening the future of the region's beleaguered forests, rivers, and oceans as well as the livelihoods of those who depend on them. In the past two decades, the report noted that the state of ecosystems in the region has been declining because of the activities such as conversion of primary forests to agricultural land or monoculture plantations; extensive coastal developments and unsustainable exploitation of marine resources; and conversion of freshwater ecosystem for agricultural use. The joint ADB-WWF study, looks in more detail at the state of erosystems in Asia-Pacific and what can be done to sustain them. It focuses on ways of preserving key large-scale regional ecosystems, including the forests of Borneo, the marine wealth of the Coral Triangle, the Mekong region's diverse habitats, and the mountainous Eastern Himalayas. These areas contain some of the region's most important natural resources on which millions of people depend for their sustenance and development. Nessim Ahmad, ADB director for Environment and Safeguards, said that major ecosystems such as the Coral Triangle and the heart of the Borneo rainforest are vital to the future of Asia Pacific "We need large scale programmutir efforts based on regional cooperation and local level action to make sure they are sustained for future generations," Ahmad added. Per capita drops Moreover, the report explained that by 2008, the per capita natural resources in these regional ecosystems had shrunk by about two-thirds compared to 1970. Despite the rich natural capital in the region, the report noted that bio-diversity is in decline in all types of ecosystems, with the rate of species loss about twice the global average. The report used the Living Planet Index - one of the more widely used indicators for tracking the state of biodiversity around the world - to measure changes in the health of ecosystems across the Asia-Pacific. The global index fell by about 30 percent between 1970 and 2008, while the Indo Pacific region shows an even greater decline of 64 per-cent in key populations of species during the same period. Across the region, the gap between the ecological footprint, or human demand for natural resources, and the environment's ability to replenish those resources is widening, it added. The report also said that the challenge for countries of Asia Pacific is to manage their natural sustainability, so that they maintain ecosystems services such as food, water, timber, pollination of crops and absorption of human waste products like carbon dioxide, to attain long-term development. "We need to create mechanisms that make protecting our resources the right economic choice for the communities that use and depend on them," said WWI Director General Jim Leape, livesting in the region's resources pays. It is estimated that every dollar spent on conservation efforts would yield an economic and social value of ecosystems worth over $100, it added. On the other hand, ADB said that it places environmentally sustainable growth at the core of its work to help seduce poverty in the region. It approved a record 59 projects supporting environmental sustainability in 2011, which amounted to about $7 billion in financing.

ASIA'S NATURAL RESOURCES GETTING STRAINED BY DEVELOPMENT -MAVVELIN U. CARBALLO THE MANILA TIMES(JUNE 07.2012) Asia Pacific countries must maintain their natural capital such as forests, biodiversity, freshwater, and coastal and marine ecosystems to achieve o green economy, according to a joint report by the Asian Development Bank(ADB) and Worldwide Fund for Nature (WWF). The report entitled "Ecological Footprint and Investment in Natural Capital in Asia and the Pacific" said that the Asia Pacific region is consuming more resources than its ecosystems can sustain, threatening the future of the region's beleaguered forests, rivers, and oceans as well as the livelihoods of those who depend on them. In the past two decades, the report noted that the state of ecosystems in the region has been declining because of the activities such as conversion of primary forests to agricultural land or monoculture plantations; extensive coastal developments and unsustainable exploitation of marine resources; and conversion of freshwater ecosystem for agricultural use. The joint ADB-WWF study, looks in more detail at the state of erosystems in Asia-Pacific and what can be done to sustain them. It focuses on ways of preserving key large-scale regional ecosystems, including the forests of Borneo, the marine wealth of the Coral Triangle, the Mekong region's diverse habitats, and the mountainous Eastern Himalayas. These areas contain some of the region's most important natural resources on which millions of people depend for their sustenance and development. Nessim Ahmad, ADB director for Environment and Safeguards, said that major ecosystems such as the Coral Triangle and the heart of the Borneo rainforest are vital to the future of Asia Pacific "We need large scale programmutir efforts based on regional cooperation and local level action to make sure they are sustained for future generations," Ahmad added. Per capita drops Moreover, the report explained that by 2008, the per capita natural resources in these regional ecosystems had shrunk by about two-thirds compared to 1970. Despite the rich natural capital in the region, the report noted that bio-diversity is in decline in all types of ecosystems, with the rate of species loss about twice the global average. The report used the Living Planet Index - one of the more widely used indicators for tracking the state of biodiversity around the world - to measure changes in the health of ecosystems across the Asia-Pacific. The global index fell by about 30 percent between 1970 and 2008, while the Indo Pacific region shows an even greater decline of 64 per-cent in key populations of species during the same period. Across the region, the gap between the ecological footprint, or human demand for natural resources, and the environment's ability to replenish those resources is widening, it added. The report also said that the challenge for countries of Asia Pacific is to manage their natural sustainability, so that they maintain ecosystems services such as food, water, timber, pollination of crops and absorption of human waste products like carbon dioxide, to attain long-term development. "We need to create mechanisms that make protecting our resources the right economic choice for the communities that use and depend on them," said WWI Director General Jim Leape, livesting in the region's resources pays. It is estimated that every dollar spent on conservation efforts would yield an economic and social value of ecosystems worth over $100, it added. On the other hand, ADB said that it places environmentally sustainable growth at the core of its work to help seduce poverty in the region. It approved a record 59 projects supporting environmental sustainability in 2011, which amounted to about $7 billion in financing.GABAY NA TAYAHIN 2 GAWAIN 8: Sagutain ang mga sumusunod na pamprosesong tanong.

The Islands of Paradise By: Richard Gula The Philippines is a sovereign state in archipelagic Southeast Asia and is home to an amazing collection of over 7,640 islands spanning more than 300,000 square kilometers of territory. These islands are divided into three regions namely Luzon, Visayas, and Mindanao Luzon is the largest and the most populous island in the Philippines which is considered the 15th largest island in the world. It is the nation's center for economy and politics, being home to the country's big factories and government's national offices including the Malacañang Palace. It is also the home of mountainous terrains, picturesque volcanoes, numerous lakes, rivers, and plains. Visayas is the smallest region in terms of land area in the central part of the archipelago. It is the home to major Philippine religious and cultural festivals such as Ati-atihan, Dinagyang, Sinulog, Pintados, and Masskara. It is also known for its famous landmarks such as the Chocolate Hills of Bohol, San Juanico Bridge of Leyte, and the island of Boracay. Mindanao is the second largest among the three islands in the southernmost part of the Philippines. It is the main contributor to the country's Gross Domestic Product (GDP) in terms of agriculture, fishing, forestry, etc. Mindanao is known to be the home of the Philippine eagle and the "king of the fruits" which is the durian. All three islands are defined by their unique location, culture, and custom. The Philippines is indeed a paradise in its true sense. Guide Questions: 1. How many islands are found in the Philippines? 2. What are the three island groups in the Philippines? 3. What makes Luzon the economic and political center of the country? 4.

Its GDP shrunk hy two tenths ofme percent for the first time in two decades according to Secretary SonyDomingues or the Department of Finance (DOF).

                        <p><strong>Answer:eto po pa brainlest po</strong></p><p></p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>The health, economic and political impact of
</p><p>COVID-19 has been significant across SouthEast Asia, but the virus has not spread as rapidly
</p><p>here as in other parts of the world. There is much
</p><p>to learn from the response to date of countries
</p><p>in the subregion as governments have acted
</p><p>swiftly and despite limited fiscal space to contain the pandemic and avoid its worst effects.
</p><p>Nonetheless, as in many other parts of the
</p><p>world, the pandemic has inflicted real suffering,
</p><p>with a disproportionate impact on the most
</p><p>vulnerable, and it has highlighted prevailing
</p><p>inequalities, concerns over governance, and
</p><p>the unsustainability of the current development pathway. It has exacerbated existing
</p><p>risks and revealed new challenges, including to
</p><p>peace and security, as well as human rights.
</p><p>This policy brief examines how the eleven
</p><p>countries1
</p><p> of South-East Asia are coping
</p><p>with the immediate impacts of COVID-19,
</p><p>focusing on the subregion’s socio-economic
</p><p>response and providing four sets of recommendations for a recovery that leads to a more
</p><p>sustainable, resilient and inclusive future:
</p><p>&gt; Tackling inequality needs to be the central
</p><p>feature of both short-term stimulus measures and long-term policy changes and
</p><p>measures for building back better. Policies
</p><p>1 Brunei, Cambodia, Lao PDR, Indonesia, Malaysia, Myanmar, Philippines, Singapore, Thailand, Timor Leste and Viet Nam.
</p><p>could prioritize the reduction of inequalities
</p><p>in income, wealth and access to basic services and social protection. This necessitates
</p><p>increased investments to strengthen health
</p><p>systems in the subregion and accelerate
</p><p>progress towards universal health care.
</p><p>Short- and long-term measures responding
</p><p>to the needs of vulnerable groups – people
</p><p>in the informal economy, women and girls,
</p><p>persons with disabilities, migrants and refugees – are necessary, recognizing that
</p><p>nobody is safe until everybody is safe.
</p><p>&gt; Bridging the digital divide across SouthEast Asia would ensure that people and
</p><p>communities are not left behind in an
</p><p>increasingly digital world, where services
</p><p>and support are increasingly based on
</p><p>digital awareness, literacy and access.
</p><p>&gt; Greening the economy needs to be a priority
</p><p>and, to that end, South-East Asian nations
</p><p>could embed long-term sustainability and
</p><p>inclusivity in their COVID-19 response and
</p><p>recovery packages, including scaling up
</p><p>investments in decarbonizing economies.
</p><p>&gt; Upholding human rights and good governance practices remains an important
</p><p>bedrock. Building back better, by definition,
</p><p>needs to include respecting and fulfilling

ASIA'S NATURAL RESOURCES GETTING STRAINED BY DEVELOPMENT -MAVVELIN U. CARBALLO THE MANILA TIMES(JUNE 07.2012) Asia Pacific countries must maintain their natural capital such as forests, biodiversity, freshwater, and coastal and marine ecosystems to achieve o green economy, according to a joint report by the Asian Development Bank(ADB) and Worldwide Fund for Nature (WWF). The report entitled "Ecological Footprint and Investment in Natural Capital in Asia and the Pacific" said that the Asia Pacific region is consuming more resources than its ecosystems can sustain, threatening the future of the region's beleaguered forests, rivers, and oceans as well as the livelihoods of those who depend on them. In the past two decades, the report noted that the state of ecosystems in the region has been declining because of the activities such as conversion of primary forests to agricultural land or monoculture plantations; extensive coastal developments and unsustainable exploitation of marine resources; and conversion of freshwater ecosystem for agricultural use. The joint ADB-WWF study, looks in more detail at the state of erosystems in Asia-Pacific and what can be done to sustain them. It focuses on ways of preserving key large-scale regional ecosystems, including the forests of Borneo, the marine wealth of the Coral Triangle, the Mekong region's diverse habitats, and the mountainous Eastern Himalayas. These areas contain some of the region's most important natural resources on which millions of people depend for their sustenance and development. Nessim Ahmad, ADB director for Environment and Safeguards, said that major ecosystems such as the Coral Triangle and the heart of the Borneo rainforest are vital to the future of Asia Pacific "We need large scale programmutir efforts based on regional cooperation and local level action to make sure they are sustained for future generations," Ahmad added. Per capita drops Moreover, the report explained that by 2008, the per capita natural resources in these regional ecosystems had shrunk by about two-thirds compared to 1970. Despite the rich natural capital in the region, the report noted that bio-diversity is in decline in all types of ecosystems, with the rate of species loss about twice the global average. The report used the Living Planet Index - one of the more widely used indicators for tracking the state of biodiversity around the world - to measure changes in the health of ecosystems across the Asia-Pacific. The global index fell by about 30 percent between 1970 and 2008, while the Indo Pacific region shows an even greater decline of 64 per-cent in key populations of species during the same period. Across the region, the gap between the ecological footprint, or human demand for natural resources, and the environment's ability to replenish those resources is widening, it added. The report also said that the challenge for countries of Asia Pacific is to manage their natural sustainability, so that they maintain ecosystems services such as food, water, timber, pollination of crops and absorption of human waste products like carbon dioxide, to attain long-term development. "We need to create mechanisms that make protecting our resources the right economic choice for the communities that use and depend on them," said WWI Director General Jim Leape, livesting in the region's resources pays. It is estimated that every dollar spent on conservation efforts would yield an economic and social value of ecosystems worth over $100, it added. On the other hand, ADB said that it places environmentally sustainable growth at the core of its work to help seduce poverty in the region. It approved a record 59 projects supporting environmental sustainability in 2011, which amounted to about $7 billion in financing.
