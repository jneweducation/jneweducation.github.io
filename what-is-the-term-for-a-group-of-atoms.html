Recall from Activity 3 how metals behave to attain stability. 2. Visualize what will happen to a group of metallic atoms. 3. Prepare a model that will represent a metallic bond. You may draw it. Guide Question: Q 19. What do you think will make bonding among metals possible? Your teacher will explain to you how metallic bonding takes place. After she explains, try to describe some metallic properties. Try to explain those properties in terms of the way metallic atoms are bonded together. In Table 3, list down the metallic properties that you know and try to explain why metals possess those properties.​</a>

                                            Activity 2: The Hydrocarbons! Hydrocarbons are organic compounds that contain carbon and hydrogen atoms only. Hydrocarbons such as methane, ethane and butane are components of natural gas. Hydrocarbons are grouped into families namely alkanes, alkenes and alkynes. The compounds in each group have certain structures that make their properties different from the others. Direction: Study Tables 1 to 3 to answer the questions in this activity. Guide Questions: 1. What are the types of bonds present in the following: alkanes, alkenes, and alkynes? 2. Using Tables 1 to 3, what pattern do you observe in terms of the phase, number of carbon atoms, structure, and boiling point of the alkanes, alkenes and alkynes? Table 1.

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p>according to our activity,

phase observed:

a.) In Alkanes (table 1)
Methane, Ethane,Propane,Butane are in gas state.
Pentene,Hexane,Heptane, and Octane are in a liquid state.

b.) in alkenes (table 2)
Ethene, propane, 1-butane are in a gas state.
1-pentene and 1-hexene are in liquid state.

c.) in Alkynes (table 3)
Ethyne, propyne, and 2-butane are in gas state, while Pentyne are in liquid state.


Observed Number of carbon atoms:

Alkanes - form single bonds with other carbon atoms.

Alkenes - form a double bonds between carbon atoms.

Alkynes - form triple bonds between carbon atoms.


Boiling point:

boiling points of alkanes, alkenes, alkynes refer to their structure. their temperature in which substance goes from liquid to gas phase.
as you observed, when the molecule interacts less with each other it is likely to form a gaseous state often for those small structures.
when the molecule closely interacts with each other it is likely to form a liquid state often for those bigger structures.

                        <p><strong>METALS</strong></p><p>     <strong>Metals </strong>are shiny, opaque materials that effectively transfer heat and electricity. The majority of metals are ductile and malleable, and they are often denser than other elements.</p>In order to achieve a stable electron configuration, <strong>metals must lose electrons; </strong>non-metals must receive electrons. Ordinarily, a noble metal is thought of as a metallic chemical element that is typically resistant to corrosion and can be found in nature in its unprocessed state. Most frequently, this classification applies to gold, platinum, and the other metals in the platinum group (ruthenium, rhodium, palladium, osmium, and iridium).The <strong>positive ions </strong>that the electrons leave behind interact with the <strong>valence electrons </strong>to create the cohesive or binding force that keeps the metallic crystal together.Metals have a relatively low electronegativity, or attraction to electrons, the valence electrons of metals can flow freely in this way. The metallic connections that hold the positive metal ions together <strong>produce a lattice-like structure.</strong><p><strong>Metal Properties</strong></p>The ability of a material to withstand the environment's reaction to change into a more stable condition is known as <strong>corrosion resistance.</strong>The formula for calculating an object's <strong>density </strong>is its mass (M) divided by its volume (V) (V). Initially, the practical use of density was to assess the reliability of gold, as in the legend of the golden crown.The <strong>melting point </strong>is a crucial factor. Because non-metal molds can resist higher temperatures needed to melt steel, many casting factories use sand casting techniques like airset or shell mold casting. On the other hand, because aluminum has a significantly lower melting point than steel, it can be cast using reusable steel molds.Heat capacity, thermal conductivity, and thermal expansion are examples of <strong>thermal propertie</strong>s. All three characteristics play a significant role in manufacturing when selecting the appropriate alloy.<p>Learn more about <strong>Metal Properties</strong>: https://brainly.ph/question/983334</p><p><strong>#SPJ1</strong></p><p></p><br />
