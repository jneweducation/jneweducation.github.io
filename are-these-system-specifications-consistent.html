                                            Directions: Tell whether the following statement is true or false.1.An axiomatic system consists of undefined terms, definedterms, axioms, and theorems.2. Theorems are proved using undefined terms, definedterms, axioms, a logical system, and/or previoustheorems3. A model of an axiomatic system is obtained by assigningmeaning to the undefined terms of the axiomatic system insuch a way that the axioms are true statements about theassigned concepts.4. Euclid's postulates 1, 2, 3, and 4 can be used to provepostulate 5 (or Euclidean Parallel Postulate).An axiomatic system should be consistent for it to belogically valid.6. Independence and completenessnecessaryrequirements of an axiomatic system.7. Some terms remain undefined to avoid circular definition .8. Points, lines and planes are undefined terms in geometry.9.Euclid's first five assumptions are not specific in geometryin which he called them postulates and the other five arespecifically geometric which he called them commonnotions.10In our daily lives, we use true statements based on facts asour reasons in order to arrive at a conclusion. In thismanner, we are applying axiomatic system.​</a>
