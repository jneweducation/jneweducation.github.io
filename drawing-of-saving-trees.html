                                            Motorboat Miracle Motorboats have always thrilled me. I love to read about them and dream about them, don't you? But here is a motorboat story that is quite different. I am sure you have never read anything like it before. Yet it is absolutely true, It happened during the war in the South Pacific. The motorboat, a fine launch, was taken over by the military soon after war was declared. Emissionary and a motorboat miracle. Naturally, the white man in charge was sorry to give it up, but there was nothing else to do. The enemy was drawing nearer every week. The natives were sorry, too, for they knew this boat well, and to them it was a messenger of light. Some time later, when the Allied Forces had to leave these islands, the military decided to destroy the launch in order to prevent its falling into the enemy's hands. So, they sent someone to pour petrol over the little vessel and set a match to it. There was a sudden explosion and a spurt of flame. But a sharp gust of wind blew out the flames, and the boat, though slightly charred, was left unharmed. Soon the white people had all gone and only the natives were left. They decided that they would try to save the launch. So they towed it away and hid it far up a little creek. Then, they planted bushes on its deck, and fast-growing vines, so that it could not be seen by enemy planes. Then, to make absolutely sure that the boat would be of no use to the enemies should they discover its hiding place, the natives decided to remove the engine and scatter the parts all over the island. With wrench and spanner and screwdriver they took that motor apart. They had changed it into a pile of nuts, bolts, screws, rings, pistons, spark plugs, and all the rest. Then came the task of hiding these parts, so that the enemy could not possibly find them. But it should be in such a way that they could be easily gathered together again. Some of the larger parts, they buried in the sand. The crankshaft was tied to the branch of a tall tree. As for the nuts, bolts, washers, and little things like that, they were carefully tied together, a few at a time, and hung around the necks of the natives. They guessed that the Japanese would presume that they were just wearing charms. They guessed right. And they wore those "charms" round their necks until the war ended. No enemy spy once suspected what they really were. At last the tide of war turned. The Japanese fled, and the Allies came back. Shortly after that the missionary himself returned. When the natives saw him, they greeted him with great joy. Then, they asked him if he would like to see the launch.how do i summarize this in each paragraph?​</a>

                                            41. The following situations shows frugality towards the environment, EXCEPT one. *a. Anton always brings his own lunchbox, cooks his food by himself, and to usually eat inside his office, instead of buying something outside during lunch breaks.b. Jordan has a lot of plastic bottles at home, so instead of throwing it all away, he uses these plastic bottles as pot to his plants, Christmas decorations, and even made a roof out of it.c. When the pandemic started, Ambreigh usually buy clothes online. She has lots of new clothes now, so she thought giving her old clothes to the ones who are in need or sell it online, than to throw it all away.d. Rafael is a frustrated artist and during his past time, he usually sketches something in order to relax. But every time he draws something and didn’t like the result in the end, he usually crumples the paper, throw it away and repeat. That’s why every day, he let her mother buy him a new sketch pad.42. How does the virtues of prudence and frugality significant in saving one’s environment? *1 pointa. A habitual practice must be done in order to exercise prudence and frugality towards saving the environment.b. The ability to become prudent and frugal, could be one of the ways to become wiser in any decision-making process.c. It guides us on how we can make good and right decisions and careful management to resources that are only limited and available to us.d. It is through these virtues that we can be good stewards of God and has a greater chance that we will be rewarded for the good deeds we made.43. When the pandemic started, and longer lockdowns were imposed in the country, a lot of unplanned pregnancies happened knowing that everybody is just at home during that time. With that, Covid 19- babies are increasing, which technically leads to increasing of population in general. Do you think that this is a good indicator and is beneficial towards our environment, and why? Choose the BEST option. *a. Yes, because more and more people will plant trees and engage to other environmental initiatives than ever before.b. No, because it is annoying to see a lot of people especially children playing outside, which results to noise pollution.c. Yes, because the more people, the more the merrier. That means, more people will help mitigate and combat the climate crisis today.d. No, because the increase of population would mean that there will be more carbon footprints, and more people will share the limited amount of resources, thus making it worse for the environment as we try to look ways as to where to get and how to allocate these limited resources for everyone.44. “Environment is the reflection of our actions.” What does this statement imply? *1 pointa. The statement goes the same with this quote, “You are what you eat.”b. People will only take good action/s if they think the environment is in dire of help.c. The way we treat the environment, highly depends on its aesthetic and its significance to the people.d. The kind of environment we have right now mirrors on how human beings treat the environment, whether positively or negatively.45. Our very existence heavily relies on consumption in order to survive. With this reality, is it justifiable to always use the environment extensively to serve our own self-interests? *a. No, but if it’s for the greatest happiness for the greater number of people, then it is total fine.b. Yes, because there is no way that we can survive in this co-dependent and co-existent world if we don’t rely with the resources available in our environment.c. Yes, because it is what it is and it’s part of the natural order of things where we humans must consume and make use of the resources anytime and anywhere, we want.d.

                                            THE DAY OF DESTINY Mordred makes himself King of England and incestuously claims Guinevere as his wife. Guinevere escapes to the Tower of London. The Bishop of Canterbury reproaches Mordred for his usurpation and would-be incest, and when Mordred tries to kill him, he flees and becomes a hermit. Mordred wins many Englishmen to his side, then meets Arthur at Dover but is forced to retreat from him. In this battle, Gawain is mortally wounded. As he dies, he admits to Arthur that if it were not for his insane pride in insisting on unjust revenge, Lancelot would be here now to save the kingdom; then he writes Lancelot, begging him to come help Arthur and also to pray at his tomb. Then, bleeding from the wound he got originally from Lancelot - with the fated sword of Balyn Gawain dies. Arthur meets Mordred again at the battle of Bareon Down and again puts him to flight. They meet next at Salisbury Plain, and there, with all who loved Lancelot fighting on Mordred's side, they prepare for what is to be their last battle. The night before the battle, Arthur dreams he is on the Wheel of Fortune, sitting on a throne and dressed in the richest gold that can be made. After the prophetic dream he has another. Gawain and a number of ladies come to him to warn him against fighting in the morning for if Arthur fights, he will die; if he waits for a month, Lancelot will be here to help him. Then Gawain and the ladies vanish. Arthur asks a truce, and the two armies meet on the field to set terms. An adder appears, a knight unthinkingly draws his sword to kill it, and the two armies are at war. At the end of the day, Mordred is the only man of his army left standing, and Arthur has only two knights, Sir Lucan and Sir Bedivere. Against Sir Lucan's advice, Arthur fights Mordred and kills him, but he gets his own death wound as he does it. Lucan and Bedivere bear him to a chapel. Robbers overrun the battlefield stealing the gear of dead knights, killing any that have life left in them. Arthur is dying and cannot be moved to safety. And so he sends Bedivere to throw Excalibur into the lake nearby, then return and tell what he has seen. Bedivere hides the sword under a tree, thinking it too precious to throw away, then returns and says he has obeyed. "What did you see?" Arthur asks. Bedivere says he saw only waves and winds. Arthur sends him twice more, and the last time Bedivere does as he has been commanded. A hand catches the sword and brandishes it three times. Then at Arthur's command, Bedivere carries the king to the waterside, where a barge awaits him and some ladies in black hoods. Bedivere puts Arthur in the barge and he is borne away to Avilon, perhaps to heal his wounds, perhaps to die. Bedivere wanders through a forest until he comes to where a hermit is kneeling over a fresh grave. It is the grave of a man brought to him at midnight by ladies in black. Whether or not the body is really that of Arthur, no one knows. Some say Arthur still lives, and some say riot.13.) Where did Bedivere carry King Arthur? Who came to get King Arthur's Body?14.) Who did she encounter as he wandered through the forest?​please po need npo.</a>

                                            Motorboat Miracle Motorboats have always thrilled me. I love to read about them and dream about them, don't you? But here is a motorboat story that is quite different. I am sure you have never read anything like it before. Yet it is absolutely true, It happened during the war in the South Pacific. The motorboat, a fine launch, was taken over by the military soon after war was declared. Emissionary and a motorboat miracle. Naturally, the white man in charge was sorry to give it up, but there was nothing else to do. The enemy was drawing nearer every week. The natives were sorry, too, for they knew this boat well, and to them it was a messenger of light. Some time later, when the Allied Forces had to leave these islands, the military decided to destroy the launch in order to prevent its falling into the enemy's hands. So, they sent someone to pour petrol over the little vessel and set a match to it. There was a sudden explosion and a spurt of flame. But a sharp gust of wind blew out the flames, and the boat, though slightly charred, was left unharmed. Soon the white people had all gone and only the natives were left. They decided that they would try to save the launch. So they towed it away and hid it far up a little creek. Then, they planted bushes on its deck, and fast-growing vines, so that it could not be seen by enemy planes. Then, to make absolutely sure that the boat would be of no use to the enemies should they discover its hiding place, the natives decided to remove the engine and scatter the parts all over the island. With wrench and spanner and screwdriver they took that motor apart. They had changed it into a pile of nuts, bolts, screws, rings, pistons, spark plugs, and all the rest. Then came the task of hiding these parts, so that the enemy could not possibly find them. But it should be in such a way that they could be easily gathered together again. Some of the larger parts, they buried in the sand. The crankshaft was tied to the branch of a tall tree. As for the nuts, bolts, washers, and little things like that, they were carefully tied together, a few at a time, and hung around the necks of the natives. They guessed that the Japanese would presume that they were just wearing charms. They guessed right. And they wore those "charms" round their necks until the war ended. No enemy spy once suspected what they really were. At last the tide of war turned. The Japanese fled, and the Allies came back. Shortly after that the missionary himself returned. When the natives saw him, they greeted him with great joy. Then, they asked him if he would like to see the launch. please help me i dont understand it ​</a>

                            11. THE DAY OF DESTINY Mordred makes himself King of England and incestuously claims Guinevere as his wife. Guinevere escapes to the Tower of London. The Bishop of Canterbury reproaches Mordred for his usurpation and would-be incest, and when Mordred tries to kill him, he flees and becomes a hermit. Mordred wins many Englishmen to his side, then meets Arthur at Dover but is forced to retreat from him. In this battle, Gawain is mortally wounded. As he dies, he admits to Arthur that if it were not for his insane pride in insisting on unjust revenge, Lancelot would be here now to save the kingdom; then he writes Lancelot, begging him to come help Arthur and also to pray at his tomb. Then, bleeding from the wound he got originally from Lancelot - with the fated sword of Balyn Gawain dies. Arthur meets Mordred again at the battle of Bareon Down and again puts him to flight. They meet next at Salisbury Plain, and there, with all who loved Lancelot fighting on Mordred's side, they prepare for what is to be their last battle. The night before the battle, Arthur dreams he is on the Wheel of Fortune, sitting on a throne and dressed in the richest gold that can be made. After the prophetic dream he has another. Gawain and a number of ladies come to him to warn him against fighting in the morning for if Arthur fights, he will die; if he waits for a month, Lancelot will be here to help him. Then Gawain and the ladies vanish. Arthur asks a truce, and the two armies meet on the field to set terms. An adder appears, a knight unthinkingly draws his sword to kill it, and the two armies are at war. At the end of the day, Mordred is the only man of his army left standing, and Arthur has only two knights, Sir Lucan and Sir Bedivere. Against Sir Lucan's advice, Arthur fights Mordred and kills him, but he gets his own death wound as he does it. Lucan and Bedivere bear him to a chapel. Robbers overrun the battlefield stealing the gear of dead knights, killing any that have life left in them. Arthur is dying and cannot be moved to safety. And so he sends Bedivere to throw Excalibur into the lake nearby, then return and tell what he has seen. Bedivere hides the sword under a tree, thinking it too precious to throw away, then returns and says he has obeyed. "What did you see?" Arthur asks. Bedivere says he saw only waves and winds. Arthur sends him twice more, and the last time Bedivere does as he has been commanded. A hand catches the sword and brandishes it three times. Then at Arthur's command, Bedivere carries the king to the waterside, where a barge awaits him and some ladies in black hoods. Bedivere puts Arthur in the barge and he is borne away to Avilon, perhaps to heal his wounds, perhaps to die. Bedivere wanders through a forest until he comes to where a hermit is kneeling over a fresh grave. It is the grave of a man brought to him at midnight by ladies in black. Whether or not the body is really that of Arthur, no one knows. Some say Arthur still lives, and some say riot.13.) Where did Bedivere carry King Arthur? Who came to get King Arthur's Body?14.) Who did she encounter as he wandered through the forest?​please po need npo.</h2><br />

                            14. Motorboat Miracle Motorboats have always thrilled me. I love to read about them and dream about them, don't you? But here is a motorboat story that is quite different. I am sure you have never read anything like it before. Yet it is absolutely true, It happened during the war in the South Pacific. The motorboat, a fine launch, was taken over by the military soon after war was declared. Emissionary and a motorboat miracle. Naturally, the white man in charge was sorry to give it up, but there was nothing else to do. The enemy was drawing nearer every week. The natives were sorry, too, for they knew this boat well, and to them it was a messenger of light. Some time later, when the Allied Forces had to leave these islands, the military decided to destroy the launch in order to prevent its falling into the enemy's hands. So, they sent someone to pour petrol over the little vessel and set a match to it. There was a sudden explosion and a spurt of flame. But a sharp gust of wind blew out the flames, and the boat, though slightly charred, was left unharmed. Soon the white people had all gone and only the natives were left. They decided that they would try to save the launch. So they towed it away and hid it far up a little creek. Then, they planted bushes on its deck, and fast-growing vines, so that it could not be seen by enemy planes. Then, to make absolutely sure that the boat would be of no use to the enemies should they discover its hiding place, the natives decided to remove the engine and scatter the parts all over the island. With wrench and spanner and screwdriver they took that motor apart. They had changed it into a pile of nuts, bolts, screws, rings, pistons, spark plugs, and all the rest. Then came the task of hiding these parts, so that the enemy could not possibly find them. But it should be in such a way that they could be easily gathered together again. Some of the larger parts, they buried in the sand. The crankshaft was tied to the branch of a tall tree. As for the nuts, bolts, washers, and little things like that, they were carefully tied together, a few at a time, and hung around the necks of the natives. They guessed that the Japanese would presume that they were just wearing charms. They guessed right. And they wore those "charms" round their necks until the war ended. No enemy spy once suspected what they really were. At last the tide of war turned. The Japanese fled, and the Allies came back. Shortly after that the missionary himself returned. When the natives saw him, they greeted him with great joy. Then, they asked him if he would like to see the launch. please help me i dont understand it ​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer: 1.The natives and the missionary in-charge were sorry when the military took over the mission launch or the motorboat. The white man in charge was also sorry, but he had no choice since war was declared and the boat was needed for military purposes.</strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong>2.The Allied forces destroyed the motorboat before they left the islands to prevent it from falling into the enemy's hands. They poured petrol over the boat and set it on fire, but a sudden gust of wind blew out the flames, leaving the boat slightly charred but unharmed.</strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong>3.After the destruction, the motorboat was slightly charred but unharmed.</strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong>4.The natives tried to save the launch by towing it away and hiding it up a little creek.

It also demonstrates their ingenuity in finding ways to hide the boat's parts so that the enemy would not find them.

The miracle referred to here may be the gust of wind that blew out the flames and saved the boat from destruction, or it could be the miracle of the natives' determination and loyalty that enabled them to protect the launch and its parts from the enemy.</strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong>Explanation:ik your welcome</strong></p><p></p><br />
