                                            Learning Task No. 3: Read the given information about sounds. Answer the guide questions at the end of the lesson. Write your answers in your notebook. Have your parents/guardian sign your work. Sound is the energy things produce when they vibrate (move back and forth quickly). If you bang a drum, you make the tight skin vibrate at very high speed (it's so fast that you can't usually see it), forcing the air all around it to vi- brate as well. As the air moves, it carries energy out from the drum in all direc- tions. Eventually, even the air inside your ears starts vibrating—and that's when you begin to perceive the vibrating drum as a sound. In short, there are two dif- ferent aspects to sound: there's a physical process that produces sound energy to start with and sends it shooting through the air, and there's a sepa- rate psychological process that happens inside our ears and brains, which con- vert the incoming sound energy into sensations we interpret as noises, speech, and music. Sound is like light in some ways: it travels out from a definite source (such as an instrument or a noisy machine), just as light travels out from the Sun or light bulb. But there are some very important differences between light and sound as well. We know light can travel through a vacuum because sun- light has to race through the vacuum of space to reach us on Earth. Sound, however, cannot travel through a vacuum: it always has to have something to travel through (known as a medium), such as air, water, glass, or metal. (Reference: Hewitt, P. et al.

Have your parents/guardian sign your work. Sound is the energy things produce when they vibrate (move back and forth quickly). If you bang a drum, you make the tight skin vibrate at very high speed (it's so fast that you can't usually see it), forcing the air all around it to vi- brate as well. As the air moves, it carries energy out from the drum in all direc- tions. Eventually, even the air inside your ears starts vibrating—and that's when you begin to perceive the vibrating drum as a sound. In short, there are two dif- ferent aspects to sound: there's a physical process that produces sound energy to start with and sends it shooting through the air, and there's a sepa- rate psychological process that happens inside our ears and brains, which con- vert the incoming sound energy into sensations we interpret as noises, speech, and music. Sound is like light in some ways: it travels out from a definite source (such as an instrument or a noisy machine), just as light travels out from the Sun or light bulb. But there are some very important differences between light and sound as well. We know light can travel through a vacuum because sun- light has to race through the vacuum of space to reach us on Earth. Sound, however, cannot travel through a vacuum: it always has to have something to travel through (known as a medium), such as air, water, glass, or metal. (Reference: Hewitt, P. et al. Conceptual Physical Science Explorations) 1. What is a sound? 2. How do we produce sounds? 3. Does sound travel/propagate through a medium? 4. Describe the transmission of sound through solids, liquids and gases.​</h2><br />
                        SOUND ENERGYAnswer:<p>1. What is a sound? </p><p>• Sound, just like heat and light, is also an energy which is produced by vibration.</p><p>2. How do we produce sounds?</p><p>• Sounds can be produced by physical or psychological process. In the physical process, sound can be produced by physical means – the things that we can touch and see. Examples are banging of drums, clapping of hands, blowing of trumpet and playing a guitar. In the psychological process, sound occurs inside the ears and brain that converts the sounds that enter and can be interpreted into speech, music or noise.</p><p>3. Does sound travel/propagate through a medium? </p><p>• Yes, sound travels through a medium. Unlike light that can travel through a vacuum, sound needs a medium to propagate. This is the reason why light is faster than sound – lightning can be perceived first than thunder although they are created at the same time.</p><p>4. Describe the transmission of sound through solids, liquids and gases.​</p><p>• Sound travels the fastest in solids since the molecules are very compact to each other while it travels the slowest in gas (air). </p><p></p><p>Read more about sound:</p><p>https://brainly.ph/question/3532664</p><p></p><p><strong>#BRAINLYFAST</strong></p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answers to the questions about force in dance.</strong></p><p></p><p>Despite being a physical-heavy type of activity, dancing is also equipped with many theories that are worth to be noted. Usually, these theories explain every nit bit of dancing, including its elements, how to practice a good kind of <strong>dancing</strong>, as well as putting those theories in reality.</p><p></p><p>One such thing is called the<strong> force or energy in dancing</strong>. According to the ballethispanico website, force, or is sometimes referred to as the energy in dancing, is when a dancer applies heavier energy or weight in each movement of his/ her dancing. There are various categories of this, namely sharp movement, light movement, heavy movement, bound movement, and free movement.</p><p></p>To understand my point in regards to dancing, take a look at these answers to the original questions about dancing:<p></p>As per the definition of force in dancing, we can easily see that A is the correct answer here. The statement deals with whether a dancer is lively and energetic, which are qualities of force in dancing.<strong>A. Exploring the movement framework</strong>, selecting movement elements. This is the correct answer because an average high school student has been taught about these things in previous years.<strong>C. Sharp and fluid.</strong> You may refer to the explanation about force or energy in dancing as written above. All else is the incorrect answer since they are not the correct categories or qualities in force or energy in dancing.<strong>D. Side and front </strong>are the examples of space.<strong>C. Walking, running, and galloping</strong> are a few examples of locomotor movements. There are also other examples.C. Food is most definitely not an element of dancing since whether we have eaten it or not does hold significance in our movements in dancing, so C is the correct answer.<p></p><p>Learn more about<strong> the topic of elements in dancing</strong> by visiting https://brainly.ph/question/1600644</p><p>#SPJ2</p><br />
