                    <p> Smallpox is a virus with a fatality rate of about 30%, and those that survive the disease have terrible scarring and lingering problems. Edward Jenner is famous for a now notorious experiment in which he developed the first vaccine for smallpox. In the experiment Jenner first exposed a small boy to cowpox, which is relatively harmless. The boy got cowpox and recovered. Jenner then exposed the boy to smallpox by walking him through a hospital ward. The boy lived.   Which conclusion is NOT valid? A)	Cowpox virus can be used as a vaccine against smallpox.	 B)	Immunity to cowpox virus also grants immunity to smallpox.	 C)	Cowpox virus and smallpox virus are probably very similar.	 D)	Smallpox virus would be a good choice for a vaccine against cowpox.	</p>

He did his study in 1796, and although he did not inventthis method, he is often considered the father of vaccines because of his scientific approachthat proved the method workedVaccine took its name from vaccinia, the virus that caused cowpox. It was the originalIngredient used to vaccinate people against smallpox.Vaccine protects the vaccinated persons and those around them who are vulnerable to thediseases, reducing the risk of diseases spreading among family members, school mates orcolleagues, friends, neighbors and other people in the community.​</a>

 Directions: Match each statement with its corresponding step number in the Scientific Method.
___ Jenner made small incisions or punctures with cowpox material in arms of human subjects in order to prevent smallpox.
___ If I infect someone with cowpox, they will then be immune to smallpox.
___ At first his peers doubted the safety and efficacy of his treatment, but eventually the value of the cowpox inoculum was recognized.
___ He saw that the people that he infected with cow pox, when later exposed to smallpox, would get a little bit sick, but never come down with a full-blown case of smallpox.
___ Dr. Jenner was aware that farm workers believed that if you had ever contracted cowpox you wouldn't get smallpox.
___ Does having cowpox make a person immune to smallpox?

                                            A vaccine is a biological substance designed to protect humans from infections caused by bacteria and viruses. It works by training the immune system to recognize and combat pathogens, either viruses or bacteria. 
Though no vaccine is 100% effective, many come quite close. For instance, two doses of the chickenpox vaccine are 98% effective against any form of chickenpox. In fact, many vaccines against deadly diseases – such as smallpox, yellow fever, measles are over 95% effective, as long as they are administered on schedule. History has also attested to the effectiveness of vaccines. 
However, there was also an issue in our country about Dengvaxia indicated for the prevention of dengue disease caused by dengue virus. The Department of Health suspended a school-based vaccine program utilizing French drug maker Sanofi Pasteur’s Dengvaxia vaccine due to a number of deaths from various complications that allegedly attributed to the vaccine product. By August 2019, over 600 people, mostly children, who received the vaccine have died. It must be emphasized that not all of these deaths are due to the vaccine itself. Regardless, the DOH banned the vaccine’s sale or use in the Philippines. 
Now, thinking of our current situation, if a vaccine for Corona virus should be available, would you consider taking the vaccine? Why or why not? Do you think that the government should have a mandatory law for every one to get vaccinated for the protection of the community or should it be a choice to the individual? Justify your answer.

                            1.  Smallpox is a virus with a fatality rate of about 30%, and those that survive the disease have terrible scarring and lingering problems. Edward Jenner is famous for a now notorious experiment in which he developed the first vaccine for smallpox. In the experiment Jenner first exposed a small boy to cowpox, which is relatively harmless. The boy got cowpox and recovered. Jenner then exposed the boy to smallpox by walking him through a hospital ward. The boy lived.   Which conclusion is NOT valid? A)	Cowpox virus can be used as a vaccine against smallpox.	 B)	Immunity to cowpox virus also grants immunity to smallpox.	 C)	Cowpox virus and smallpox virus are probably very similar.	 D)	Smallpox virus would be a good choice for a vaccine against cowpox.	</h2><br />
                        Hello!<br />The answer to your question is letter "D. Smallpox virus would be a good choice for a vaccine against cowpox".<br />.<br />Reasons:<br />- You can't use a virus that is similar to the virus a person have to cure it. You can't cure a virus by a virus.<br />- The question says that when the boy recovered, Jenner then exposed the boy to smallpox by walking him through a hospital ward. The boy already recovered from cowpox and the exposure to smallpox happened after it. So, it is clear that smallpox have no involvement in the boy recovering from cowpox.<br />:)<br />

                        Smallpox was an infectious disease caused by one of two virus variants, Variola major and Variola minor. The agent of variola virus (VARV) belongs to the genus Orthopoxvirus.  The last naturally occurring case was diagnosed in October 1977, and the World Health Organization (WHO) certified the global eradication of the disease in 1980.[10] The risk of death after contracting the disease was about 30%, with higher rates among babies. Often those who survived had extensive scarring of their skin, and some were left blind.[6]Smallpox was an infectious disease caused by one of two virus variants, Variola major and Variola minor.The agent of variola virus (VARV) belongs to the genus Orthopoxvirus.

                            29. A vaccine is a biological substance designed to protect humans from infections caused by bacteria and viruses. It works by training the immune system to recognize and combat pathogens, either viruses or bacteria. 
Though no vaccine is 100% effective, many come quite close. For instance, two doses of the chickenpox vaccine are 98% effective against any form of chickenpox. In fact, many vaccines against deadly diseases – such as smallpox, yellow fever, measles are over 95% effective, as long as they are administered on schedule. History has also attested to the effectiveness of vaccines. 
However, there was also an issue in our country about Dengvaxia indicated for the prevention of dengue disease caused by dengue virus. The Department of Health suspended a school-based vaccine program utilizing French drug maker Sanofi Pasteur’s Dengvaxia vaccine due to a number of deaths from various complications that allegedly attributed to the vaccine product. By August 2019, over 600 people, mostly children, who received the vaccine have died. It must be emphasized that not all of these deaths are due to the vaccine itself. Regardless, the DOH banned the vaccine’s sale or use in the Philippines. 
Now, thinking of our current situation, if a vaccine for Corona virus should be available, would you consider taking the vaccine? Why or why not? Do you think that the government should have a mandatory law for every one to get vaccinated for the protection of the community or should it be a choice to the individual? Justify your answer.

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>in my opinion, no</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>In my opinion, i think i wont be taking the corona virus vaccine just because im not infected and i don't really trust the vaccine itself. I think that maybe if a few Filipinos tries it and "died", I'll take that as a caution or warning, but now we do t have a heads-up / we still dont know if its effective. My other reason is just it just came out, just like the dengvaxia, we tried it as soon it came out, Thats why I dont trust it lol</p><br />
