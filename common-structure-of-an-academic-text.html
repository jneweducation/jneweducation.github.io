                                            Activity 2.1 Why does academic writing need to be formal, objective, complex, concise and specific? To find the answer to this question read the text below and underline the word that best completes each sentence. An academic is responsible for expanding the boundaries of knowledge. This is serious business and a/an 1) (informal, formal , complex) writing style reflects the Importance and sincerity of this work. If an academic text contains informal casual language, the credibility of the writer is weakened. Therefore, in an academic text you see 2) (formal, concise, sophisticated) academic vocabulary and words written in their 3) (shorter, complex, full) form. Academic writing appears 4) (complex, concise, specialized) because it often refers to abstract ideas, whereas everyday language is more concrete and familiar. Academic subjects have their own 5) (specialized, formal, unnecessary) vocabulary too which students of other subjects may not be familiar with. Oddly, if English is not your first language, the importance of being 6) (complex, concise, objective) in academic writing adds to this complexity. Sentences that are structured around 7) (noun, verb, adverb) phrases are generally 8) (unnecessary, complex, concise) and clearer than sentences constructed around 9) (noun, verb, adverb), but they may be more difficult for students to write. The same is true when writers use sentences that contain subordinate clauses or lists. Sophisticated adverbs and connecting words, and 10) (use, definitions, highlighting) of important words also add to the darity and precision of academic writing. An academic paper should be written in an 11) (academic, objective, informal) style. Academics focus on information and argumentation. In other words, they establish the facts by writing about what they have leamed from others and from that own research, and how this has led to new conclusions. This style of writing therefore avoids personal 12) (pronouns, words, stories) and the passive voice is a common linguistic feature. Emotional language is also avoided. Being assertive, and therefore appearing superior and arrogant, is regarded negatively. Writers are expected to be cautious, or tentative, about the conclusions they come to and so 13) (hesitating complexity, hedging) is another typical characteristic of academic writing​</a>

However, while technology has made writing more accessible, it has also created new challenges for students who struggle with grammar, punctuation, and style. To address these challenges, Grammarly apps have emerged as a powerful tool for enhancing students' writing skills. Grammarly checker software is an application that assists writers in detecting various types of language errors and grammar mistakes in English. According to Ghufron (2019), Grammarly checker plays a crucial role in identifying errors in English writing. Its primary function is to check the text's spelling and ensure that typos are eliminated from the context. This application facilitates writing production by controlling and maintaining accuracy. Furthermore, it provides free plagiarism checks and can detect academic errors, such as plagiarism or data similarity from other online sources. Therefore, Grammarly software is effective in identifying similarities. Bailey &amp; Lee (2020) also suggested that Grammarly checker software is essential in the context of English writing learning, as noted by Lassoued et al. (2020). Grammarly is a tool designed to help improve written English by checking for errors and suggesting corrections. Its primary function is to identify and correct typos and other mistakes, ensuring that written content is accurate and clear Qassemzadeh &amp; Soleimani (2016). In addition to error correction, Grammarly also provides writing assistance for grammar and spelling, and it is equipped with a plagiarism detector. By comparing written text to a vast database of published works and online content, Grammarly can detect any instances of plagiarism or improper citation. Overall, Grammarly is a valuable tool for anyone seeking to improve their written communication skills and maintain academic integrity. Grammarly is a writing assistance tool created by Grammarly, Inc. The application employs artificial intelligence and natural language processing technology to aid users in enhancing their writing skills. It achieves this by detecting and correcting grammatical errors, spelling mistakes, and punctuation errors. Furthermore, it provides suggestions for improving sentence structure, word selection, and overall clarity. The researchers have proposed a strategy that involves using apps to analyze large amounts of text data and identify common patterns of errors among students. By analyzing these patterns, Grammarly's algorithms can learn to detect and correct a wide range of writing mistakes. The app also provides users with feedback on their writing style, including suggestions for making their content more engaging and impactful. Grammarly's objective is to assist users in effectively communicating their ideas, whether it be through writing emails, reports, or other professional documents, by ensuring their written content is clear and precise.​</a>

                                            Using celebrities in advertising dates back to the late nineteenth century, and this common advertising practice has drawn a considerate amount of academic and practical attention (see Erdogan 1999 for an extensive review). Most academic investigations of celebrity endorsement have been contextualized in the realm of source credibility and attractiveness models, and suggest that celebrities exert their influence on consumers through perceived attributes such as expertise. trustworthiness, attractiveness, familiarity and likeability (Ohanian 1990, 1991). Another stream of research on celebrity endorsement, which is labeled the "match-up hypothesis." has examined the fit or match between a celebrity and the product being endorsed, and maintains that celebrity endorsement is more effective when the images or characteristics of the celebrity are well matched with the endorsed products (Kahle and Homer 1985; Kamins 1990; Kamins and Gupta 1994; Till and Busier 2000). In similar vein, McCracken suggests that a "celebrity who best represents the appropriate symbolic properties" of the product should be selected, thus highlighting the importance of the cultural meanings of the celebrities in the endorsement process. Celebrities embody a collection of culturally relevant images, symbols, and values. As images of the celebrities become associated with products through endorsement, the meanings they attach to the products are transferred to consumers through purchase and consumption (McCracken 1989, 316). Therefore, the practice of celebrity endorsement should be closely related to the cultural context in which the images of celebrities are formed and individual celebrities are selected to be linked with particular products. For advertising practitioners, employing an appropriate celebrity endorser to promote a product is important but a difficult task. For instance in the theoretical literature, professionals at advertising agencies and their client companies in the United States and the United Kingdom cited celebrity attributes such as image, trustworthiness, and familiarity, as well as the fit between the celebrity and the product, as important factors for choosing the appropriate endorsers (Erdogan, Baker, and Tagg 2001: Miciak and Shanklin 1994). Other highly ranked decision factors include celebrity/target-audience congruence, costs of securing the celebrity, the celebrity's risk of controversy, and the celebrity's prior endorsement. As suggested by Erdogan, Baker and Tagg (2011), the perceived importance and the actual use of endorser selection criteria may vary from culture to culture. Differences in the entertainment industry and agency business, and more broadly, in the cultural environments are likely to influence the execution of the celebrity endorsement strategy across countries. Arguing for standardized advertising across countries, some contend that consumer demands and tastes have become similar on a global scale (Levitt 1983; Taylor and Johnson 2002) and that using celebrities with worldwide recognition in advertising is an effective means of overcoming cultural difficulties (Erdogan 1999, Kaikati 1987; La Ferla 2001). Others claim that despite some observed convergence among consumers around the world, fundamental values still remain divergent across cultures. Therefore, international advertisers cannot assume that the same advertising technique should be uniformly applied or that it will be equally effective in different counties (De Mooji 1998, 2003; Onkvisit and Shaw 1999). Yet research on similarities and differences between cultures in the use of celebrity endorsement in advertising is scarce, despite the potential cultural influence on this technique as speculated in the literature.Questions:1.

For instance in the theoretical literature, professionals at advertising agencies and their client companies in the United States and the United Kingdom cited celebrity attributes such as image, trustworthiness, and familiarity, as well as the fit between the celebrity and the product, as important factors for choosing the appropriate endorsers (Erdogan, Baker, and Tagg 2001: Miciak and Shanklin 1994). Other highly ranked decision factors include celebrity/target-audience congruence, costs of securing the celebrity, the celebrity's risk of controversy, and the celebrity's prior endorsement. As suggested by Erdogan, Baker and Tagg (2011), the perceived importance and the actual use of endorser selection criteria may vary from culture to culture. Differences in the entertainment industry and agency business, and more broadly, in the cultural environments are likely to influence the execution of the celebrity endorsement strategy across countries. Arguing for standardized advertising across countries, some contend that consumer demands and tastes have become similar on a global scale (Levitt 1983; Taylor and Johnson 2002) and that using celebrities with worldwide recognition in advertising is an effective means of overcoming cultural difficulties (Erdogan 1999, Kaikati 1987; La Ferla 2001). Others claim that despite some observed convergence among consumers around the world, fundamental values still remain divergent across cultures. Therefore, international advertisers cannot assume that the same advertising technique should be uniformly applied or that it will be equally effective in different counties (De Mooji 1998, 2003; Onkvisit and Shaw 1999). Yet research on similarities and differences between cultures in the use of celebrity endorsement in advertising is scarce, despite the potential cultural influence on this technique as speculated in the literature.Questions:1.

                            11. Activity 2.1 Why does academic writing need to be formal, objective, complex, concise and specific? To find the answer to this question read the text below and underline the word that best completes each sentence. An academic is responsible for expanding the boundaries of knowledge. This is serious business and a/an 1) (informal, formal , complex) writing style reflects the Importance and sincerity of this work. If an academic text contains informal casual language, the credibility of the writer is weakened. Therefore, in an academic text you see 2) (formal, concise, sophisticated) academic vocabulary and words written in their 3) (shorter, complex, full) form. Academic writing appears 4) (complex, concise, specialized) because it often refers to abstract ideas, whereas everyday language is more concrete and familiar. Academic subjects have their own 5) (specialized, formal, unnecessary) vocabulary too which students of other subjects may not be familiar with. Oddly, if English is not your first language, the importance of being 6) (complex, concise, objective) in academic writing adds to this complexity. Sentences that are structured around 7) (noun, verb, adverb) phrases are generally 8) (unnecessary, complex, concise) and clearer than sentences constructed around 9) (noun, verb, adverb), but they may be more difficult for students to write. The same is true when writers use sentences that contain subordinate clauses or lists. Sophisticated adverbs and connecting words, and 10) (use, definitions, highlighting) of important words also add to the darity and precision of academic writing. An academic paper should be written in an 11) (academic, objective, informal) style. Academics focus on information and argumentation. In other words, they establish the facts by writing about what they have leamed from others and from that own research, and how this has led to new conclusions. This style of writing therefore avoids personal 12) (pronouns, words, stories) and the passive voice is a common linguistic feature. Emotional language is also avoided. Being assertive, and therefore appearing superior and arrogant, is regarded negatively. Writers are expected to be cautious, or tentative, about the conclusions they come to and so 13) (hesitating complexity, hedging) is another typical characteristic of academic writing​</h2><br />

However, while technology has made writing more accessible, it has also created new challenges for students who struggle with grammar, punctuation, and style. To address these challenges, Grammarly apps have emerged as a powerful tool for enhancing students' writing skills. Grammarly checker software is an application that assists writers in detecting various types of language errors and grammar mistakes in English. According to Ghufron (2019), Grammarly checker plays a crucial role in identifying errors in English writing. Its primary function is to check the text's spelling and ensure that typos are eliminated from the context. This application facilitates writing production by controlling and maintaining accuracy. Furthermore, it provides free plagiarism checks and can detect academic errors, such as plagiarism or data similarity from other online sources. Therefore, Grammarly software is effective in identifying similarities. Bailey &amp; Lee (2020) also suggested that Grammarly checker software is essential in the context of English writing learning, as noted by Lassoued et al. (2020). Grammarly is a tool designed to help improve written English by checking for errors and suggesting corrections. Its primary function is to identify and correct typos and other mistakes, ensuring that written content is accurate and clear Qassemzadeh &amp; Soleimani (2016). In addition to error correction, Grammarly also provides writing assistance for grammar and spelling, and it is equipped with a plagiarism detector. By comparing written text to a vast database of published works and online content, Grammarly can detect any instances of plagiarism or improper citation. Overall, Grammarly is a valuable tool for anyone seeking to improve their written communication skills and maintain academic integrity. Grammarly is a writing assistance tool created by Grammarly, Inc. The application employs artificial intelligence and natural language processing technology to aid users in enhancing their writing skills. It achieves this by detecting and correcting grammatical errors, spelling mistakes, and punctuation errors. Furthermore, it provides suggestions for improving sentence structure, word selection, and overall clarity. The researchers have proposed a strategy that involves using apps to analyze large amounts of text data and identify common patterns of errors among students. By analyzing these patterns, Grammarly's algorithms can learn to detect and correct a wide range of writing mistakes. The app also provides users with feedback on their writing style, including suggestions for making their content more engaging and impactful. Grammarly's objective is to assist users in effectively communicating their ideas, whether it be through writing emails, reports, or other professional documents, by ensuring their written content is clear and precise.​</h2><br />

                            18. Using celebrities in advertising dates back to the late nineteenth century, and this common advertising practice has drawn a considerate amount of academic and practical attention (see Erdogan 1999 for an extensive review). Most academic investigations of celebrity endorsement have been contextualized in the realm of source credibility and attractiveness models, and suggest that celebrities exert their influence on consumers through perceived attributes such as expertise. trustworthiness, attractiveness, familiarity and likeability (Ohanian 1990, 1991). Another stream of research on celebrity endorsement, which is labeled the "match-up hypothesis." has examined the fit or match between a celebrity and the product being endorsed, and maintains that celebrity endorsement is more effective when the images or characteristics of the celebrity are well matched with the endorsed products (Kahle and Homer 1985; Kamins 1990; Kamins and Gupta 1994; Till and Busier 2000). In similar vein, McCracken suggests that a "celebrity who best represents the appropriate symbolic properties" of the product should be selected, thus highlighting the importance of the cultural meanings of the celebrities in the endorsement process. Celebrities embody a collection of culturally relevant images, symbols, and values. As images of the celebrities become associated with products through endorsement, the meanings they attach to the products are transferred to consumers through purchase and consumption (McCracken 1989, 316). Therefore, the practice of celebrity endorsement should be closely related to the cultural context in which the images of celebrities are formed and individual celebrities are selected to be linked with particular products. For advertising practitioners, employing an appropriate celebrity endorser to promote a product is important but a difficult task. For instance in the theoretical literature, professionals at advertising agencies and their client companies in the United States and the United Kingdom cited celebrity attributes such as image, trustworthiness, and familiarity, as well as the fit between the celebrity and the product, as important factors for choosing the appropriate endorsers (Erdogan, Baker, and Tagg 2001: Miciak and Shanklin 1994). Other highly ranked decision factors include celebrity/target-audience congruence, costs of securing the celebrity, the celebrity's risk of controversy, and the celebrity's prior endorsement. As suggested by Erdogan, Baker and Tagg (2011), the perceived importance and the actual use of endorser selection criteria may vary from culture to culture. Differences in the entertainment industry and agency business, and more broadly, in the cultural environments are likely to influence the execution of the celebrity endorsement strategy across countries. Arguing for standardized advertising across countries, some contend that consumer demands and tastes have become similar on a global scale (Levitt 1983; Taylor and Johnson 2002) and that using celebrities with worldwide recognition in advertising is an effective means of overcoming cultural difficulties (Erdogan 1999, Kaikati 1987; La Ferla 2001). Others claim that despite some observed convergence among consumers around the world, fundamental values still remain divergent across cultures. Therefore, international advertisers cannot assume that the same advertising technique should be uniformly applied or that it will be equally effective in different counties (De Mooji 1998, 2003; Onkvisit and Shaw 1999). Yet research on similarities and differences between cultures in the use of celebrity endorsement in advertising is scarce, despite the potential cultural influence on this technique as speculated in the literature.Questions:1.
