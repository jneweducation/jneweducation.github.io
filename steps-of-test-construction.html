Choose your variables I decided to test the following variables: Different methods of teaching strategies and the number of study hours of students.
Choose your topic I am a senior high teacher, and i am interested to know what factors are affecting the academic performance of my Grade 12 STEM class.
Choose your relationships After some testing and data gathering, it is observable that different methods of teaching strategies and the number of study hours of students have a significant effect on academic performance of Grade 12 STEM class of AMAES.
Make your research question "What are the factors that affect the academic performance of Grade 12 STEM class of AMAES?"
Conduct a review of the literature I read some updated researches and journals to gain some insights into what things influence the academic performance of a student.</a>

                                            Hypothesis testing is a vital part of a decision-making process under the areaof statistics and research. A hypothesis test assesses two mutually independentstatements about a population. Decision making process helps any individual tosolve problems by examining alternative choices and deciding which best path totake. A step by step approach makes it efficient and effective in making sound, andwell-versed decisions that leads to a constructive impact on the area you areinvestigatingNever be afraid of rejections, if you want to find the truth make a hypothesis,compare observations, then decide; " the result confirms the hypothesis, thenyou've made a measurement; i it contradicts, then you've made a discovery"Enrico Fermi.Have you been rejected without any obvious reason?

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p></p><p></p><p>The given directions are for constructing an electromagnet, not for designing an experiment to determine the factors that affect the strength of the electromagnet. Here are the steps for designing such an experiment:</p><p></p><p>1. Identify the independent variables that may affect the strength of the electromagnet. These could include the number of turns of wire around the iron core, the amount of current passing through the wire, the diameter of the wire, and the type of core material used.</p><p></p><p>2. Choose a dependent variable that can be measured to determine the strength of the electromagnet. This could be the weight of iron filings that the electromagnet can lift, the number of paper clips that can be attracted to the electromagnet, or the strength of the magnetic field that the electromagnet produces.</p><p></p><p>3. Control the other variables that may affect the experiment, such as the distance between the electromagnet and the iron filings, the size and shape of the iron filings or paper clips, and the voltage of the dry cell.</p><p></p><p>4. Set up the experiment by constructing the electromagnet with the chosen core material and wire diameter, and wind a specific number of turns of wire around the core.</p><p></p><p>5. Connect the ends of the wire to a power source and gradually increase the current through the wire while measuring the dependent variable.</p><p></p><p>6. Repeat the experiment several times with different combinations of independent variables to determine their effects on the strength of the electromagnet.</p><p></p><p>7. Record the results and analyze the data to draw conclusions about which factors have the greatest effect on the strength of the electromagnet.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>pa brainlest po</p><br />

                            29. Hypothesis testing is a vital part of a decision-making process under the areaof statistics and research. A hypothesis test assesses two mutually independentstatements about a population. Decision making process helps any individual tosolve problems by examining alternative choices and deciding which best path totake. A step by step approach makes it efficient and effective in making sound, andwell-versed decisions that leads to a constructive impact on the area you areinvestigatingNever be afraid of rejections, if you want to find the truth make a hypothesis,compare observations, then decide; " the result confirms the hypothesis, thenyou've made a measurement; i it contradicts, then you've made a discovery"Enrico Fermi.Have you been rejected without any obvious reason?

A researcher hypothesized that the average adult body temperature is lower than the often-advertised 98.6 degrees F. That is, the researcher wants an answer to the question: "Is the average adult body temperature 98.6 degrees? Or is it lower?" To answer his research question, the researcher starts by assuming that the average adult body temperature was 98.6 degrees F.</p><p></p><p>Then, the researcher went out and tried to find evidence that refutes his initial assumption. In doing so, he selects a random sample of 130 adults. The average body temperature of the 130 sampled adults is 98.25 degrees.</p><p></p><p>Then, the researcher uses the data he collected to make a decision about his initial assumption. It is either likely or unlikely that the researcher would collect the evidence he did given his initial assumption that the average adult body temperature is 98.6 degrees:</p><p></p><p>If it is likely, then the researcher does not reject his initial assumption that the average adult body temperature is 98.6 degrees. There is not enough evidence to do otherwise.</p><p>If it is unlikely, then:</p><p>either the researcher's initial assumption is correct and he experienced a very unusual event;</p><p>or the researcher's initial assumption is incorrect.</p><p>In statistics, we generally don't make claims that require us to believe that a very unusual event happened.
