It causes the gap between rich and poor to increase and hence blocks for consumerism. Phrased in another way: If the middle class disappears or is impoverished, it cannot afford to buy the many new products created by smart young people, and as a result the economy stagnates.</p><br />

It causes the gap between rich and poor to increase and hence blocks for consumerism.
