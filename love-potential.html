                                            Imagine you were in a situation where someone in your family was extremely ill. Your relative’s doctor says that there is an experimental medicine that might help your loved one, expressing that it is the only thing that might work. Your family has very limited financial means. The medication costs Php 50,000 per month and health insurance will not cover the cost. You try to borrow money to pay for a course of treatment but are unable to do so. When faced with a financial barrier to a potentially life saving treatment for someone you love, would stealing money to pay for the medication be morally justified? Why? Why not?​</a>
