An interview with John Moe (writer, humorist,
and National Public Radio host ) on the
pandemic and mental health
The percentage of people reporting symptoms of
depression, and a disorder level of depression is way up,
John emphasizes, and this does not show signs of
decreasing anytime soon.
“There’s this concept I read about called the
bereavement multiplier, where for every person who dies
of COVID-19, there are on average nine people in their
immediate family who will be grieving. If you take that
number and multiply it times the number of people who
have died, you have millions of people feeling stuck,
missing work, and not functioning at their best.”
John thinks that trauma, which is “completely under-
recognized as a source for mental disorders” explains the
rapidly increasing numbers of people experiencing mental
illness during the pandemic. He believes this influx of new
cases will put a tremendous strain on a mental health
care system that is already ill-equipped to receive them
and tells us that “there are parts of the country where
there’s barely any health professionals for the number of
people who live there.”
Along with bringing much-needed awareness to this
problem, John feels that some sort of system needs to be
put into place to effectively treat the growing amount of
people experiencing mental illness. He feels this can only
happen when there is proper representation of mental
health professionals on the White House Council on
Coronavirus.

An interview with John Moe (writer, humorist,
and National Public Radio host ) on the
pandemic and mental health
The percentage of people reporting symptoms of
depression, and a disorder level of depression is way up,
John emphasizes, and this does not show signs of
decreasing anytime soon.
“There’s this concept I read about called the
bereavement multiplier, where for every person who dies
of COVID-19, there are on average nine people in their
immediate family who will be grieving. If you take that
number and multiply it times the number of people who
have died, you have millions of people feeling stuck,
missing work, and not functioning at their best.”
John thinks that trauma, which is “completely under-
recognized as a source for mental disorders” explains the
rapidly increasing numbers of people experiencing mental
illness during the pandemic. He believes this influx of new
cases will put a tremendous strain on a mental health
care system that is already ill-equipped to receive them
and tells us that “there are parts of the country where
there’s barely any health professionals for the number of
people who live there.”
Along with bringing much-needed awareness to this
problem, John feels that some sort of system needs to be
put into place to effectively treat the growing amount of
people experiencing mental illness. He feels this can only
happen when there is proper representation of mental
health professionals on the White House Council on
Coronavirus.
