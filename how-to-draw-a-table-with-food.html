                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>When you think of your hair, you probably think of the hair on your head. But there's hair on almost every part of your body. (Places that don't have hair include the lips, the palms of the hands, and the soles of the feet.)</p><p></p><p>Some of the hair on your body is easy to see, like your eyebrows and the hair on your head, arms, and legs. But other hair, like that on your cheek, is almost invisible.</p><p></p><p>Depending on where it is, hair has different jobs. The hair on your head keeps your head warm and provides a little cushioning for your skull. Eyelashes protect your eyes by decreasing the amount of light and dust that go into them, and eyebrows protect your eyes from sweat dripping down from your forehead.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>Sorry Po Yan Lang alam Ki</p><p></p><p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>1.Black</p><p>2.White </p><p>3.mom and dad</p><p>4.dolls</p><p>5.Vegetables</p><p>6.the child are praising the elders and do the right way</p><p>7.the child was nice and kind to others</p><p>8.filipino say at the end of the word is "Po or Opo" and they call when the others are older is "Ate, kuya,Lola, auntie, etc</p><p>9.What it ask was the child and her elder treating nice</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>Tama? </p><br />
