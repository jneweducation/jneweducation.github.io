                                            No matter how often we sweep the floor of our homes, we are still able to gather together a considerable amount of dust. Dust is all around us. It gathers on bookshelves, on furniture - old or new. These particles rest on any still object – undisturbed until touched or wiped clean. Dust, which was first believed to be made of dead skin has been found to be a mix of different things. Some of the common ingredients of dust particles include animal fur, dead insects, food, fiber from clothes, beddings, soil and other chemicals. Although most of household dust comes from the outside through doors, windows and shoes, other dust particles come from within. Scientists have discovered that the mix of dust from each household actually depends on four things: the climate, the age of the house, the number of persons who live in it and their individual cooking, cleaning and smoking habits. Making our homes free of dust may not be possible but lessening the amount of dust that we keep in our homes will help avoid possible allergies and allow us to breathe well.

Text #1 It is physically impossible for a well-educated, intellectual, or brave man to make money the chief object of his thoughts just as it is for him to make his dinner the principal object of them. All healthy people like their dinners, but their dinner is not the main object of their lives. So all healthy minded people like making money ought to like it and enjoy the sensation of winning it; it is something better than money. A good soldier, for instance, mainly wishes to do his fighting well. He is glad of his pay-very properly so and justly grumbles when you keep him ten years without it-till, his main mission of life is to win battles, not to be paid for winning them. So of clergymen. The clergyman's object is essentially baptize and preach not to be paid for preaching. So of doctors. They like fees no doubt-ought to like them; yet if they are brave and well-educated the entire object to their lives is not fees. They on the whole, desire to cure the sick; and if they are good doctors and 26 Summary a Precis and the choice were fairly to them, would rather cure their patient and lose their fee than kill him and get it. And so with all the other brave and rightly trained men: their work is first, their fee second-very important always; but still second.  Text #2 Home is the young, who known "nothing of the world and who would be forlorn and sad, if thrown upon it. It is providential, shelter of the weak and inexperienced, who have to learn as yet to cope with the temptations which lies outside of it. It is the place of training of those who are not only ignorant, but have no yet learnt how to learn, and who have to be taught by careful individual trail, how to set about profiting by the lessons of teacher. And it is the school of elementary studies-not of advances, for such studies alone can make master minds. Moreover, it is the shrine of our best affections, the bosom of our fondest recollections, at spell upon our after life, a stay for world weary mind and soul; wherever we are, till the end comes. Such are attributes or offices of home, and like to these, in one or other sense or measure, are the attributes and offices of a college in a university.  Text #3 Teaching is the noblest of professions. A teacher has a sacred duty to perform. It is he on whom rests the responsibility of moulding the character of young children. Apart from developing their intellect, he can inculcate in them qualities of good citizenship, remaining neat and clean, talking decently and sitting properly. These virtues are not easy to be imbibed. Only he who himself leads a life of simplicity, purity and rigid discipline can successfully cultivate these habits in his pupils. Besides a teacher always remain young. He may grow old in age, but not in spite. Perpetual contact with budding youths keeps him happy and cheerful. There are moments when domestic worries weigh heavily on his mind, but the delightful company of innocent children makes him overcome his transient moods of despair. ​</a>

Success element One is the (1) which is important to an organization's It is defined as the manner in which a management achieves the right combination of differentiation and integration of the organization's operations, in response to the level of uncertainty in its external environment. There are two main classifications of organizational theories regarding organizational design: the (2). and the (3) Among the traditional ones is (4) considered as a very basio organizational structure and commonly used by beginning entrepreneurs. For better organizational porformance, a simple structure may develop into a functional structure as the company expands. This particular design groups (5) jobs or tasks into one department for a more effective performance. When the company grows so big that it now has multiple products or branches in different areas, the (6) may be beneficial. Those units are under one parent company that oversees them. The (7) is one of the modern types of organizational design theories, where the workers' different skills and abilities are put together in groups. Companies adapting this organizational design theory enjoys the no chain of command condition. On the other hand, the (8) is characterized by having a double chain of command, where workers have two managers to report to. The last of the modern types knows no chain of command as well, for this organizational design theory is not limited by vertical, horizontal, and external boundaries. This is the (9) organization theory. The decision to adapt a certain organizational design theory rests on the management considering their current business situation and the changing external environment. It is therefore, very sensible to say that (10) utilized by an organization is substantial to the accomplishment of a firm's objectives.​</a>

A roller coaster car of mass m starts from rest at the top of a hill of heighth and slides down the hill, reaching a speed of v at the bottom. Assume that there is nofrictional force acting on the car. a. it possible for the roller coaster car to reach the bottom of the hill withless kinetic energy than it would have if it had been released from rest at the bottom of the hill instead of the top? If so, explain how this could happen. If not, explain why not b. At what point(s) during the roller coaster ride does the car experience a change in gravitational potential energy without a corresponding change inkinetic energy? How is this possible, and what is the significance of this observation in the context of the conservation of anergy?2. An object of mass m is lifted to a height in above the ground and held stationary a. At what point(s) during the motion of the lifted object does it have the maximum and minimum potential energy? Describe how the change inpotential energy affects the motion of the object, and how the law ofconservation of energy is applicable in this context. hit the object is released from rest at the top of the height, describe the motion of the object as it fails and explain how the total mechanical energy of the system remains conserved during its free fall. How does the velocity of the object vary with time, and how can you relate this to the conservationof energy principle? c. How would the answers to parts (a) and (b) change if the object was lifted to a different height, or if the object had a different mass? Explain yourreasoning, including any relevant equations and physical principles d. Finally, consider the scenario where the object is not lifted to a height but is instead given an initial velocity vo in the upward direction. How does the mation of the object differ from that in part (b)7 in particular, how does the maximum height reached by the object depend on its initial velocity, and what is the significance of this in the context of the conservation of energy?​</a>

                                            Suggested Time Allotment 15 minutes Self-improvement does not only manifest in your physical look as it can also be seen n your behavior or command of emotions. Hence, when you develop self-discipline, you can see yourself regulating your emotions well and deciding carefully before taking actions, There's nothing wrong if you feel different emotions such as being happy, angry, excited, sad, Inspired, or disappointed as those are normal reaction of any human being but the timing and the manner of expression make a difference. For instance, if you are angry, it is not an excuse to hurt other or break the things at home; or if you are happy, it is not enough reason to forget about your important and immediate tasks. There are proper ways and time to express those things and leaming them means having self-discipline. The following are just seven ways to increase self-discipline, as you can learn other things from other respected sources: : 7 Ways to Improve Self-Discipline Commit to your goal. Whether it's getting over your emotions or getting enough sleep at night, it is important to go back to your goals; remind yourself why you need to do it and stick to it. Objectivity is the key. Don't be too hard on yourself but don't be too easy as well. Put yourself in another perspective aside from yours so that you can look at a bigger picture of the situation. Never underestimate willpower. Use your inner strength to resist temptations that will set you back from your goals. Think of your motivation. People have attested that constantly being presented with the reasons why they set their goals has an immense effect in helping them achieve what they want. Rest and reset. You don't have to always outrun your goals. There are days when you walk on much slower pace and feel less motivated but use those days to help you power through and reach your goals. Overwhelming yourself may not be okay. Don't set too many unrealistic goals that you'll have trouble finishing. It's better to set one at a time than be overwhelmed with too many that you can no longer handle. Live a life with a can-do attitude. Believe in yourself and in your ability to attain whatever goal you want. Self-discipline has been regarded as a staple key in achieving balance in one's life Now that we have been ushered into a new normal brought by the pandemic, the importan of having control in ourselves should be highlighted.​</a>

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Quarantine is an ancient tool used to prevent the spread of disease. The Bible describes the sequestering of persons with leprosy, and the practice was used widely in 14th-century Europe to control the spread of bubonic and pneumonic plague. To prevent disease transmission, ships were required to stay in harbor for 40 days before disembarkation (thus the term quarantine, which derives from the Latin quadragina or the Italian quaranta, meaning 40).</p><p></p><p>Quarantine has been used for centuries, but because it was often implemented in a way that equated disease with crime, the practice has negative connotations.</p><p></p><p>Persons under quarantine were often detained without regard to their essential needs. Those who were exposed but not yet ill were not always separated from the ill, allowing disease to spread within the detained group. Populations targeted for quarantine, such as foreigners, were stigmatized. In some cases, the power of quarantine was abused; for example, at the end of the 19th century, the steerage passengers on arriving ships were frequently quarantined while the firstand second-class passengers were allowed to disembark without being examined for illness.</p><p></p><p>Despite its history, quarantine—when properly applied and practiced according to modern public health principles—can be a highly effective tool in preventing the spread of contagious disease. It may play an especially important role when vaccination or prophylactic treatment is not possible, as was the case with severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). Even when direct medical counter-measures are available (e.g., smallpox and pneumonic plague), reducing mobility in the at-risk population may enable the most rapid and efficient delivery of postexposure vaccination and chemoprophylaxis.</p><p></p><p>Isolation and Quarantine</p><p>Before discussing the role of quarantine as a component of community response and containment for SARS, it is necessary to distinguish, from a public health perspective, between the related practices of isolation and quarantine. Both are usually imposed by health officials on a voluntary basis; however, federal, state, and local officials have the authority to impose mandatory quarantine and isolation when necessary to protect the public’s health.</p><p></p><p>Isolation refers to the separation and restricted movement of ill persons who have a contagious disease in order to prevent its transmission to others. It typically occurs in a hospital setting, but can be done at home or in a special facility. Usually individuals are isolated, but the practice may be applied in larger groups.</p><p></p><p>Quarantine refers to the restriction of movement or separation of well persons who have been exposed to a contagious disease, before it is known whether they will become ill. Quarantine usually takes place in the home and may be applied at the individual level or to a group or community of exposed persons.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><br />

                            10. No matter how often we sweep the floor of our homes, we are still able to gather together a considerable amount of dust. Dust is all around us. It gathers on bookshelves, on furniture - old or new. These particles rest on any still object – undisturbed until touched or wiped clean. Dust, which was first believed to be made of dead skin has been found to be a mix of different things. Some of the common ingredients of dust particles include animal fur, dead insects, food, fiber from clothes, beddings, soil and other chemicals. Although most of household dust comes from the outside through doors, windows and shoes, other dust particles come from within. Scientists have discovered that the mix of dust from each household actually depends on four things: the climate, the age of the house, the number of persons who live in it and their individual cooking, cleaning and smoking habits. Making our homes free of dust may not be possible but lessening the amount of dust that we keep in our homes will help avoid possible allergies and allow us to breathe well.

Text #1 It is physically impossible for a well-educated, intellectual, or brave man to make money the chief object of his thoughts just as it is for him to make his dinner the principal object of them. All healthy people like their dinners, but their dinner is not the main object of their lives. So all healthy minded people like making money ought to like it and enjoy the sensation of winning it; it is something better than money. A good soldier, for instance, mainly wishes to do his fighting well. He is glad of his pay-very properly so and justly grumbles when you keep him ten years without it-till, his main mission of life is to win battles, not to be paid for winning them. So of clergymen. The clergyman's object is essentially baptize and preach not to be paid for preaching. So of doctors. They like fees no doubt-ought to like them; yet if they are brave and well-educated the entire object to their lives is not fees. They on the whole, desire to cure the sick; and if they are good doctors and 26 Summary a Precis and the choice were fairly to them, would rather cure their patient and lose their fee than kill him and get it. And so with all the other brave and rightly trained men: their work is first, their fee second-very important always; but still second.  Text #2 Home is the young, who known "nothing of the world and who would be forlorn and sad, if thrown upon it. It is providential, shelter of the weak and inexperienced, who have to learn as yet to cope with the temptations which lies outside of it. It is the place of training of those who are not only ignorant, but have no yet learnt how to learn, and who have to be taught by careful individual trail, how to set about profiting by the lessons of teacher. And it is the school of elementary studies-not of advances, for such studies alone can make master minds. Moreover, it is the shrine of our best affections, the bosom of our fondest recollections, at spell upon our after life, a stay for world weary mind and soul; wherever we are, till the end comes. Such are attributes or offices of home, and like to these, in one or other sense or measure, are the attributes and offices of a college in a university.  Text #3 Teaching is the noblest of professions. A teacher has a sacred duty to perform. It is he on whom rests the responsibility of moulding the character of young children. Apart from developing their intellect, he can inculcate in them qualities of good citizenship, remaining neat and clean, talking decently and sitting properly. These virtues are not easy to be imbibed. Only he who himself leads a life of simplicity, purity and rigid discipline can successfully cultivate these habits in his pupils. Besides a teacher always remain young. He may grow old in age, but not in spite. Perpetual contact with budding youths keeps him happy and cheerful. There are moments when domestic worries weigh heavily on his mind, but the delightful company of innocent children makes him overcome his transient moods of despair. ​</h2><br />

Success element One is the (1) which is important to an organization's It is defined as the manner in which a management achieves the right combination of differentiation and integration of the organization's operations, in response to the level of uncertainty in its external environment. There are two main classifications of organizational theories regarding organizational design: the (2). and the (3) Among the traditional ones is (4) considered as a very basio organizational structure and commonly used by beginning entrepreneurs. For better organizational porformance, a simple structure may develop into a functional structure as the company expands. This particular design groups (5) jobs or tasks into one department for a more effective performance. When the company grows so big that it now has multiple products or branches in different areas, the (6) may be beneficial. Those units are under one parent company that oversees them. The (7) is one of the modern types of organizational design theories, where the workers' different skills and abilities are put together in groups. Companies adapting this organizational design theory enjoys the no chain of command condition. On the other hand, the (8) is characterized by having a double chain of command, where workers have two managers to report to. The last of the modern types knows no chain of command as well, for this organizational design theory is not limited by vertical, horizontal, and external boundaries. This is the (9) organization theory. The decision to adapt a certain organizational design theory rests on the management considering their current business situation and the changing external environment. It is therefore, very sensible to say that (10) utilized by an organization is substantial to the accomplishment of a firm's objectives.​</h2><br />

How does the mation of the object differ from that in part (b)7 in particular, how does the maximum height reached by the object depend on its initial velocity, and what is the significance of this in the context of the conservation of energy?​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p></p><p>1a. Yes, it is possible for the roller coaster car to reach the bottom of the hill with less kinetic energy than it would have if it had been released from rest at the bottom of the hill instead of the top. This is because the roller coaster car has potential energy due to its height above the ground at the top of the hill, which gets converted into kinetic energy as it slides down the hill. So, if the roller coaster car is released from rest at the bottom of the hill, it will only have kinetic energy. But if it is released from rest at the top of the hill, it will have both potential and kinetic energy. Therefore, the roller coaster car can have the same final kinetic energy at the bottom of the hill, regardless of whether it was released from rest at the top or the bottom of the hill.</p><p></p><p>1b. The roller coaster car experiences a change in gravitational potential energy without a corresponding change in kinetic energy at the top of the hill and at the bottom of the hill. At the top of the hill, the roller coaster car has maximum potential energy and zero kinetic energy. At the bottom of the hill, the roller coaster car has maximum kinetic energy and zero potential energy. The significance of this observation is that the total mechanical energy (i.e., the sum of kinetic and potential energy) of the roller coaster car is conserved as it moves from one position to another, assuming no external forces are acting on it.</p><p></p><p>2a. The lifted object has maximum potential energy at the highest point and minimum potential energy at the ground level. When the object is lifted, work is done against gravity to increase its potential energy. When the object is lowered, work is done by gravity to decrease its potential energy. According to the law of conservation of energy, the total mechanical energy of the system (i.e., the object and the Earth) is conserved, so the decrease in potential energy is converted into an increase in kinetic energy.</p><p></p><p>2b. When the object is released from rest at the top of the height, it falls freely under the influence of gravity and its potential energy is converted into kinetic energy. The total mechanical energy of the system remains conserved during the free fall because there are no external forces acting on the object. The velocity of the object increases as it falls, and the velocity at any time can be calculated using the equation v = gt, where g is the acceleration due to gravity and t is the time. The velocity of the object increases as time increases, and the kinetic energy of the object also increases correspondingly, while the potential energy decreases. The total mechanical energy of the system remains constant.</p><p></p><p>2c. If the object is lifted to a different height or has a different mass, the maximum potential energy and the maximum height it can reach will change. The maximum potential energy is proportional to the mass and the height of the object, and the maximum height it can reach is determined by the initial potential energy and the kinetic energy at the highest point. The conservation of energy principle still applies to these scenarios.</p><p></p><p>2d. If the object is given an initial velocity vo in the upward direction, it will move upward, but its velocity will decrease due to the gravitational force until it reaches the highest point. At the highest point, the velocity is zero and the potential energy is maximum. Then, the object falls freely under the influence of gravity and its potential energy is converted into kinetic energy. The maximum height reached by the object depends on its initial velocity and can be calculated using the conservation of energy principle. The significance of this observation is that the total mechanical energy of the system remains conserved throughout the motion of the object.</p><br />

                            30. Suggested Time Allotment 15 minutes Self-improvement does not only manifest in your physical look as it can also be seen n your behavior or command of emotions. Hence, when you develop self-discipline, you can see yourself regulating your emotions well and deciding carefully before taking actions, There's nothing wrong if you feel different emotions such as being happy, angry, excited, sad, Inspired, or disappointed as those are normal reaction of any human being but the timing and the manner of expression make a difference. For instance, if you are angry, it is not an excuse to hurt other or break the things at home; or if you are happy, it is not enough reason to forget about your important and immediate tasks. There are proper ways and time to express those things and leaming them means having self-discipline. The following are just seven ways to increase self-discipline, as you can learn other things from other respected sources: : 7 Ways to Improve Self-Discipline Commit to your goal. Whether it's getting over your emotions or getting enough sleep at night, it is important to go back to your goals; remind yourself why you need to do it and stick to it. Objectivity is the key. Don't be too hard on yourself but don't be too easy as well. Put yourself in another perspective aside from yours so that you can look at a bigger picture of the situation. Never underestimate willpower. Use your inner strength to resist temptations that will set you back from your goals. Think of your motivation. People have attested that constantly being presented with the reasons why they set their goals has an immense effect in helping them achieve what they want. Rest and reset. You don't have to always outrun your goals. There are days when you walk on much slower pace and feel less motivated but use those days to help you power through and reach your goals. Overwhelming yourself may not be okay. Don't set too many unrealistic goals that you'll have trouble finishing. It's better to set one at a time than be overwhelmed with too many that you can no longer handle. Live a life with a can-do attitude. Believe in yourself and in your ability to attain whatever goal you want. Self-discipline has been regarded as a staple key in achieving balance in one's life Now that we have been ushered into a new normal brought by the pandemic, the importan of having control in ourselves should be highlighted.​</h2><br />
