                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>1. An unthinkable more than 50 million people worldwide died from the 1918-1919 flu pandemic commonly known as the “Spanish Flu.” It was the deadliest global pandemic since the Black Death, and rare among flu viruses for striking down the young and healthy, often within days of exhibiting the first symptoms.    2. <strong>  The farm of his father was destroyed by a Natural Calamity, which is flood. That is the reason why they preferred to live in a new place.     3.This is the most racist question I have ever heard. The family of the farmer does differ totally to the family of the rich man. As you can see, without farmer, no matter how rich you are, money cannot provide you with food. Why can you eat raw money? tell me, does money gives you a total comfort when you are alone? Aside from it, you cannot really see the real friends on the rich family, as you become poor due to bankruptcy, your friends will be gone since you have no money to give them impress. As you grown in the farm of even in the middle class, you will see a real friend that doesn't need your money, all they need is you. As you can see, nobody is perfect.

                        <strong>Answer:</strong>This problem involves counting the number of possible routes between three towns, where each route passes through a second town and does not repeat any roads. Let's break it down into steps:<p></p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Identify the number of roads between each pair of towns. We have 3 roads from Town A to Town B and 4 roads from Town B to Town C.</p><p></p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Determine the number of possible routes from Town A to Town C through Town B without passing through the same road twice. To do this, we can use the multiplication principle, which states that if we have m ways of doing one thing and n ways of doing another, then we have m x n ways of doing both things in sequence.</p><p></p>So, we can start by choosing one of the 3 roads from Town A to Town B, then choose one of the 4 roads from Town B to Town C, and finally choose one of the 2 remaining roads from Town C back to Town A. This gives us a total of:<p></p><p>3 x 4 x 2 = 24</p><p></p><p>possible routes from Town A to Town C and back to Town A, through Town B, without passing through the same road twice.</p><p></p><strong>Therefore, there are </strong><strong>24 possible routes to take</strong><strong>.</strong><br />

                            28. if there are 3 roads from Town A to Town B and 4 roads from Town B to Town C. How many ways can one go from Town A to C and back to Town A through the Town B without passing through the same road twice?</h2><br />
                        This problem can be solved using the Fundamental Principle of Counting or FPC. The FPC states that if one event can be done in [tex]m[/tex] ways and another event can be done in [tex]n[/tex] ways, the number of ways that the two events can happen is [tex]mn[/tex] ways. For example, if you have 2 different shirts and 5 different pair of pants, the number of possible combinations of a shirt and a pair pants that you can make is  2×5 = 10 ways.<br /><br />Now, to solve this problem, we have to remember that the route is this: From A to B, then from B to C, then from C back to B, and from B back to A. <br /><br />Let's count our choices:<br />(a) <strong>From A to B, </strong>we have <strong>3</strong> roads to choose from;<br />(b) <strong>From B to C, </strong>we have <strong>4 </strong>roads to choose from;<br />(c) In going back <strong>from C to B, </strong>we only have <strong>3 </strong>options this time since we already took one in (b), again we cannot take the same road twice;<br />(d) <strong>From B to A, </strong>we only have <strong>2</strong> roads to choose from since we already took one in (a).<br /><br />Therefore, applying the FPC now, we have a total of 3×4×3×2 = 72 ways.<br /><br />See another problem that uses FPC: brainly.ph/question/279814<br />
