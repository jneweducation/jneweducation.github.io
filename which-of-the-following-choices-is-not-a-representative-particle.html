                        <p>Based on the option gives, the correct answer is: <strong>C. ANION.</strong></p><p></p>The representative particle is any kind of particle such as a<strong>toms, electrons, ions, molecules </strong>and<strong> formula units</strong>.The <strong>anion</strong> is NOT a representative particle.<p></p><p><strong>FURTHER EXPLANATION:</strong></p><p><strong>Anions</strong> are <strong>negatively</strong> charged <strong>ions</strong>. Therefore, a cation molecule has a hydrogen proton without an electron, while an anion has an extra electron. Because of their opposite electrical charges, cations and anions are attracted to each other and readily form ionic compounds. Electrons, because of their small mass so that they occupy a large space, are considered as matter waves. It determines the entire size of the atoms and molecules that have electrons. Anions are larger than their parent molecules or atoms, because excess electrons repel each other thereby increasing the physical size of the ion, and its size is determined by its electron cloud.</p><p></p><p>Thus, in general, <strong>cations are smaller</strong> than their parent atoms or molecules because their electron cloud size is also smaller. The hydrogen cation has no electrons at all, so it only has a single proton, much smaller than a hydrogen atom. most <strong>anions are large</strong>, such as the earth's most common anion, oxygen. Based on this fact, it appears that most of the space in the crystal is occupied by anions and that cations are contained in the spaces between them.</p><p></p><p>Learn more about <strong>the size of the atoms is determined by the size of its orbitals and it is expressed by the radius of the atom:</strong></p><p>https://brainly.ph/question/15248867</p><p></p><p>#SPJ6</p><br />
