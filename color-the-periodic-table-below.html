The mats by Francisco Arcellana For the Angeles family, Mr. Angeles' homecoming from his periodic inspection trips was always an occasion for celebration. But his homecoming from a trip to the south was fated to be more (14)memorable than, say, of the others. He (15)had written from Mariveles. I have just met a (16) marvelous mat weaver, a real artist and I shall have a surprise for you. I asked him to weave a sleeping mat for every one of the family He is using many different colors and for each mat and the dominant color is that of our respective birthstones. I am sure that the children will be very pleased. I know you will be. I can hardly wait to show them to you. Nana Emilia (17) read the letter that morning, and again and again every time she had a chance to leave the kitchen. In the evening when all the children were home from school she asked her oldest son, Jose, to read the letter at dinner table. The children became very much excited about the mats, and talked about them until late into the night. This she wrote her husband when she labored over a reply to him. For days after that, mats continued to be the chief topic of conversation among the children (18) Finally, from Lopez, Mr Angeles wrote again. I am taking the Bicol Express (19) tomorrow I have the mats with me, and they are (20) beautiful. God willing. I shall be home to join you at dinner. 14 memorable 15. had written 16 marvelous 17. read A VERB B. ADJECTIVE C. ADVERB 18. Finally 19. tomorrow 20 beautiful​</a>

Orbits are regions around the nucleus where electrons are mostly likely to be found,11. Release of energy of electrons results to the emission of light,12. Energy levels contain one or more sublevels13. Atomic spectrum shows a continuous range of colors from red to violet.1.4. Louis de Broglie proposed that matter has wave-like properties. 15. Probability of finding electrons increases as you move away from the nucleus of theatom16. It is impossible to pinpoint the exact location and velocity of electrons at once.17. Energy absorption by the electron can be observed with its movement from a higherto a lower energy level18. Ground-state electrons are usually unstable.19, 1s2,2s2,2p6,3s2 4s1,3d10 is the configuration of copper that shows that it is in theground state.20.

The mats by Francisco Arcellana For the Angeles family, Mr. Angeles' homecoming from his periodic inspection trips was always an occasion for celebration. But his homecoming from a trip to the south was fated to be more (14)memorable than, say, of the others. He (15)had written from Mariveles. I have just met a (16) marvelous mat weaver, a real artist and I shall have a surprise for you. I asked him to weave a sleeping mat for every one of the family He is using many different colors and for each mat and the dominant color is that of our respective birthstones. I am sure that the children will be very pleased. I know you will be. I can hardly wait to show them to you. Nana Emilia (17) read the letter that morning, and again and again every time she had a chance to leave the kitchen. In the evening when all the children were home from school she asked her oldest son, Jose, to read the letter at dinner table. The children became very much excited about the mats, and talked about them until late into the night. This she wrote her husband when she labored over a reply to him. For days after that, mats continued to be the chief topic of conversation among the children (18) Finally, from Lopez, Mr Angeles wrote again. I am taking the Bicol Express (19) tomorrow I have the mats with me, and they are (20) beautiful. God willing. I shall be home to join you at dinner. 14 memorable 15. had written 16 marvelous 17. read A VERB B. ADJECTIVE C. ADVERB 18. Finally 19. tomorrow 20 beautiful​</h2><br />

This convenient tool contains most of the information that students and even chemists themselves need, whether they are studying an element or doing experiments. However, the amount of information packed in the periodic table can easily intimidate anyone who is new to chemistry You are a chemist and your task is to create a user guide for the periodic table of elements. The guide should be simple but has enough information. The user guide can be in the form of a brochure, pamphlet, or a booklet.

                            16. Write True if the statement is correct and False if otherwise 1. Electron configuration helps us to determine the number of electrons present inn anatom. 2. Electron configuration provides us the number of valence electrons and the main energy level occupied by the electrons3. The electron configuration of an element helps us to easily determine their position in the periodic table4. The valence electrons of an atom is always similar with its main energy level.For questions 5 to 8. Pls refer to the electron configuration of copper (Cu) below Cu = 1s, 2s, 2p°, 3s, 3p°, 4s, 3d105. The principal quantum number of Cu is 3. 6. The ms of Cu is -1/27. The I value of Cu is 28. The mi value of copper is-2 9. Uncertainty principle of the atom is proposed by Erwin Schrodinger.10. Orbits are regions around the nucleus where electrons are mostly likely to be found,11. Release of energy of electrons results to the emission of light,12. Energy levels contain one or more sublevels13. Atomic spectrum shows a continuous range of colors from red to violet.1.4. Louis de Broglie proposed that matter has wave-like properties. 15. Probability of finding electrons increases as you move away from the nucleus of theatom16. It is impossible to pinpoint the exact location and velocity of electrons at once.17. Energy absorption by the electron can be observed with its movement from a higherto a lower energy level18. Ground-state electrons are usually unstable.19, 1s2,2s2,2p6,3s2 4s1,3d10 is the configuration of copper that shows that it is in theground state.20.
