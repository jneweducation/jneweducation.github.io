                                            You are working as a
delivery person for a dairy store. In the back of your pick-up truck is a crate
of eggs. The dairy company has run out of bungee cords, so the crate is not
tied down. You have been told to drive carefully because the coefficient of
static friction between the crate and the bed of the truck is 0.6. You are
not worried, because you are traveling on a road that appears perfectly
straight. Due to your confidence and inattention, your speed has crept upward
to 45 miles per hour. Suddenly you see a curve ahead with a warning sign saying,
"Danger: unbanked curve with radius of curvature 35 m". You are 15 m from the beginning of the curve. What can you do to save the eggs: (a) take the
curve at 45 mi/h, (b) brake to a stop before entering the curve to think
about it, or (c) slow down to take the curve at a slower speed? Discuss
these options in your group and determine if there is a best course of action.

AGRRESIVE DRIVING SHOULD BE AVOIDED
Aggressive driving is a phenomenon, which has only recently got the 
public worried. The National Highway Traffic Society Council (NHTSC) defines 
aggressive driving as the “operation of a motor vehicle in a manner that 
endangers or is likely to endanger persons or property.” Actions such as 
running red lights, improper passing, overtaking on the left, improper lane 
change, failing to yield, improper turns, running stop signs, tailgating, 
careless driving and speeding are examples of aggressive driving. Such actions 
are dangerous to other road users. Aggressive driving should be avoided 
because it causes crashes, injuries, and fatalities.
 The first reason why aggressive driving should be avoided is it causes 
crashes. According to NHTSC, between 78 percent speed (excessive speed) 
and 100 percent (improper passing) of the cases of aggressive driving resulted 
in traffic crashes and 96 percent of the drivers cited for “ following too closely” 
or tailgating caused crashes as a result of their aggressive driving. Moreover, 
“running red light”, “improper passing”, and “overtaking on the left” topped 
other categories of aggressive driving in contributing to traffic crashes.
 Another reason why aggressive driving should be avoided is it causes 
injuries. NHTSC states that the percentages of the injuries caused by
aggressive driving are in almost all categories of aggressive driving, above 100 
percent.
Aggressive driving also causes fatalities. “Overtaking on the left” 
appears to be the most important contributing factor in traffic facilities as it 
relates to aggressive driving. “Improper lane change,” ”running stop sign,” 
and “running red light” rank second through four in terms of their 
contribution to fatalities.

                                            Supposed you were having your on-the-job training in a private
investigating company. You were asked to join a team assigned to
investigate a ‘hit and run’ case. The alleged suspect was captured by the
CCTV camera driving down a road leading to the place of incident. The
suspect denied the allegation, saying that he was then driving very slowly
with a constant speed. Because of the short time difference when he was
caught by the camera and when the accident happened, he insisted that it
was impossible that he would already be at the place when the crime
happened. But when you were viewing the scene again on the camera, you
noticed that his car was leaving oil spots on the road. When you checked
these spots on site, you found out that they are still evident. So you began
to wonder if the spots can be used to investigate the motion of the car of the
suspect and check whether he was telling the truth or not.</a>

                            6. You are working as a
delivery person for a dairy store. In the back of your pick-up truck is a crate
of eggs. The dairy company has run out of bungee cords, so the crate is not
tied down. You have been told to drive carefully because the coefficient of
static friction between the crate and the bed of the truck is 0.6. You are
not worried, because you are traveling on a road that appears perfectly
straight. Due to your confidence and inattention, your speed has crept upward
to 45 miles per hour. Suddenly you see a curve ahead with a warning sign saying,
"Danger: unbanked curve with radius of curvature 35 m". You are 15 m from the beginning of the curve. What can you do to save the eggs: (a) take the
curve at 45 mi/h, (b) brake to a stop before entering the curve to think
about it, or (c) slow down to take the curve at a slower speed? Discuss
these options in your group and determine if there is a best course of action.

 Circle the letter of the correct answer.
AGRRESIVE DRIVING SHOULD BE AVOIDED
Aggressive driving is a phenomenon, which has only recently got the 
public worried. The National Highway Traffic Society Council (NHTSC) defines 
aggressive driving as the “operation of a motor vehicle in a manner that 
endangers or is likely to endanger persons or property.” Actions such as 
running red lights, improper passing, overtaking on the left, improper lane 
change, failing to yield, improper turns, running stop signs, tailgating, 
careless driving and speeding are examples of aggressive driving. Such actions 
are dangerous to other road users. Aggressive driving should be avoided 
because it causes crashes, injuries, and fatalities.
 The first reason why aggressive driving should be avoided is it causes 
crashes. According to NHTSC, between 78 percent speed (excessive speed) 
and 100 percent (improper passing) of the cases of aggressive driving resulted 
in traffic crashes and 96 percent of the drivers cited for “ following too closely” 
or tailgating caused crashes as a result of their aggressive driving. Moreover, 
“running red light”, “improper passing”, and “overtaking on the left” topped 
other categories of aggressive driving in contributing to traffic crashes.
 Another reason why aggressive driving should be avoided is it causes 
injuries. NHTSC states that the percentages of the injuries caused by
aggressive driving are in almost all categories of aggressive driving, above 100 
percent.
Aggressive driving also causes fatalities. “Overtaking on the left” 
appears to be the most important contributing factor in traffic facilities as it 
relates to aggressive driving. “Improper lane change,” ”running stop sign,” 
and “running red light” rank second through four in terms of their 
contribution to fatalities.

If no, why not?</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>1. If I were interested in participating in the clean-up drive announced by my barangay, I would employ the "persuasion" interpersonal communication strategy when asking permission from my parents.</p><p></p><p>2. To convince my parents to let me participate, I could say:</p>"Mom/Dad, I know it's early on Saturday, but I really want to join the clean-up drive in our barangay. It's important to me to help out and give back to our community. Can I please go?""I promise to be safe and follow all the rules during the clean-up drive. It's only for a few hours, and I'll be back before lunchtime. Please let me go and help out."<p></p><p>3. I cannot answer whether or not I was successful since this is a hypothetical situation. However, the success of convincing my parents would depend on several factors such as my relationship with my parents, their concerns for my safety, and their willingness to allow me to participate in community activities. If my parents were supportive and believed in the importance of community service, then I may have been successful in convincing them to let me participate. However, if they had concerns for my safety or did not think it was a worthwhile activity, then I may not have been successful in convincing them.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><br />

An old lady who looks as if she is about to die.

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>The correct answer among the choices is letter a. Knowing that there can only be one passenger in your car, choosing an old lady who looks as if she is about to die is the most appropriate answer corresponding to the given situation. To be mentally healthy, you should have the ability to be able to ponder and make decision wisely based on a situation you are currently facing.

I would most definitely let the old lady be my passenger on a wild stormy night. The old lady is probably vulnerable to the cold weather and too old to be travelling alone. An old friend would understand my reason for letting the old lady in my passenger seat since his compassion for the elderly might be the same as mine having him save my life. My dream guy who may not know me must also understand the reason for my action. If he cannot, then he is not worthy to be dreamed of at all. </p><p></p><br />

investigating company. You were asked to join a team assigned to
investigate a ‘hit and run’ case. The alleged suspect was captured by the
CCTV camera driving down a road leading to the place of incident. The
suspect denied the allegation, saying that he was then driving very slowly
with a constant speed. Because of the short time difference when he was
caught by the camera and when the accident happened, he insisted that it
was impossible that he would already be at the place when the crime
happened. But when you were viewing the scene again on the camera, you
noticed that his car was leaving oil spots on the road. When you checked
these spots on site, you found out that they are still evident. So you began
to wonder if the spots can be used to investigate the motion of the car of the
suspect and check whether he was telling the truth or not.</h2><br />
