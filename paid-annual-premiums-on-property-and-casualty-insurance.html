                                            Property Insurance Company is a new property insurer. The company is growing rapidly because of a new homeowners policy that combines traditional homeowner coverages with insurance that pays off the mortgage if the insured dies or becomes totally disabled. Premiums written have increased substantially; new agents have been hired; and the company is considering expanding into additional states. However, its growth has been hampered by statutory accounting rules that require an insurer to write off immediately its first-year acquisition expenses but do not allow full recognition of premium income until the policy period has expired. In this case, explain how reinsurance will enable Property Insurance to continue to grow in an orderly fashion. </a>

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>The first year premium would be 20% of $40,000, or $8,000.</p><p>The second year premium would be 15% of $40,000, or $6,000.</p><p>The third year premium would be 10% of $40,000, or $4,000.</p><p>The total premium paid over the three years would be $8,000 + $6,000 + $4,000 = $18,000.</p><p></p><p><strong>Step-by-step explanation:</strong></p><p>1. First, calculate the premium for the first year by multiplying the policy amount by the percentage: $40,000 x 20% = $8,000</p><p>2. Next, calculate the premium for the second year by multiplying the policy amount by the percentage: $40,000 x 15% = $6,000</p><p>3. Then, calculate the premium for the third year by multiplying the policy amount by the percentage: $40,000 x 10% = $4,000</p><p>4.

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>15000y - 3000</p><p><strong>Step-by-step explanation:</strong></p><p>In this question, we are given an <strong>unknown variable</strong> y. This is unknown because the client is free to choose the number of years. </p><p>Let's first focus on the statement "... Php 15000 for every succeeding years." This means that we have to <strong>multiply</strong> 15000 into y to find the total cost for an unknown number of years. </p><p>Thus, we have the expression 15000y.</p><p>However, our expression isn't complete. The given states that the 15000 <strong>doesn't apply for</strong> the <strong>first year</strong>, just 12000. This means that we need to <strong>subtract 1 from </strong>our <strong>variable</strong>. </p><p>Now, we have the expression 15000(y-1) or 15000y - 15000.</p><p>Finally, note that the <strong>first year</strong> of premium <strong>isn't free</strong>; it costs 12000. Because of this, we need to <strong>add 12000</strong> to our expression.</p><p>We now have 15000y - 15000 + 12000. We just need to <strong>simplify</strong> this and we finally have the final answer. </p><p></p><p>Therefore, the answer to cost for an insurance premium is <strong>15000y - 3000</strong>, where y is the number of years. </p><p>Hope this helps! </p><p></p><p>#BetterAnswersAtBrainly #CarryOnLearning </p><br />

A financial advicor called five annual premiums on new policies as follows: 150,000,00 php 120,000,00 php 200,000,00 php 95,000,00 php and 300,000,00 php oftje insurance company gives a 30% commission for these premiums, how much will be the total commissions of the Advisor?</h2><br />
                        <p>To find the total commission of the advisor, we need to add up the commissions for each premium. The commission for each premium is 30% of the premium amount:</p><p></p><p>Commission = 0.3 x Premium</p><p></p><p>So for the five premiums given, the commissions are:</p><p></p><p>Commission 1 = 0.3 x 150,000,00 php = 45,000,00 php</p><p>Commission 2 = 0.3 x 120,000,00 php = 36,000,00 php</p><p>Commission 3 = 0.3 x 200,000,00 php = 60,000,00 php</p><p>Commission 4 = 0.3 x 95,000,00 php = 28,500,00 php</p><p>Commission 5 = 0.3 x 300,000,00 php = 90,000,00 php</p><p></p><p>Total commission = Commission 1 + Commission 2 + Commission 3 + Commission 4 + Commission 5</p><p></p><p>Total commission = 45,000,00 php + 36,000,00 php + 60,000,00 php + 28,500,00 php + 90,000,00 php</p><p></p><p>Total commission = 259,500,00 php</p><p></p><p>Therefore, the total commission of the advisor is 259,500,00 php.</p><br />

                            20. 6. An insurance company is deciding whether to insure the lives of those leading a quest to Malaria. Based on past experience, the probability of surviving such a quest is 91.3%. If the insurance company charges a premium of Php 5,200.00 and would pay a death benefit of Php 93,000.00 if the insured were to die, what is the expected value of this insurance policy?​</h2><br />
                        <p></p><p>The expected value of an insurance policy is the sum of the probability of each outcome multiplied by its corresponding payout. In this case, the probability of surviving the quest is 91.3% and the probability of dying is 8.7% (100% - 91.3%). The expected value of the policy is calculated as follows:</p><p></p><p>Expected value = (probability of surviving * premium) + (probability of dying * death benefit)</p><p></p><p>= (0.913 * 5200) + (0.087 * 93000)</p><p></p><p>= 4744.6 + 7901</p><p></p><p>= PHP 12645.6</p><p></p><p>Therefore, the expected value of the insurance policy is PHP 12645.6.</p><br />

If the insurance company sells 1,000 of these policies, they can expect to earn a total of 1,000 * 15,000 = Php 15,000,000 in premiums.

Premiums written have increased substantially; new agents have been hired; and the company is considering expanding into additional states. However, its growth has been hampered by statutory accounting rules that require an insurer to write off immediately its first-year acquisition expenses but do not allow full recognition of premium income until the policy period has expired.
