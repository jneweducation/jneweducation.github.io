                                            8Activity 4Direction: Make your own concept map of the four subsystems of the Earth (Atmosphere, Lithosphere, Biosphere, Hydrosphere). Use a separate sheet of paper. Note: Use the information below as your reference.INFORMATION ABOUT EARTH’S FOUR SUBSYSTEMS: 1. Definition of a System A set of interconnected components that are interacting to form a unified whole. 2. The Earth system is essentially a closed system. It receives energy from the sun and returns some of this energy to space.3. Atmosphere.A. The atmosphere is the thin gaseous layer that envelopes the lithosphere. B. The present atmosphere is composed of 78% nitrogen (N), 21% oxygen (O2), 0.9% argon, and trace amount of other gases. C. One of the most important processes by which the heat on the Earth's surface is redistributed is through atmospheric circulation. D. There is also a constant exchange of heat and moisture between the atmosphere and thehydrosphere through the hydrologic cycle.4. Lithosphere. A. The lithosphere includes the rocks of the crust and mantle, the metallic liquid outer core, and the solid metallic inner core. B. Briefly discuss the Plate Tectonics as an important process shaping the surface of the Earth. The primary driving mechanism is the Earth's internal heat, such as that in mantle convection.5. Biosphere. A. The biosphere is the set of all life forms on Earth. B. It covers all ecosystems—from the soil to the rainforest, from mangroves to coral reefs, and from the plankton-rich ocean surface to the deep sea. C. For the majority of life on Earth, the base of the food chain comprises photosynthetic organisms. During photosynthesis, CO2 is sequestered from the atmosphere, while oxygen is released as a byproduct. The biosphere is a CO2 sink, and therefore, an important part of the carbon cycle.D. Sunlight is not necessary for life. 6. Hydrosphere. A. About 70% of the Earth is covered with liquid water (hydrosphere) and much of it is in the form of ocean water. B. Only 3% of Earth's water is fresh: two-thirds are in the form of ice, and the remaining one-third is present in streams, lakes, and groundwater.C. The oceans are important sinks for CO2 through direct exchange with the atmosphere and indirectly through the weathering of rocks. D. Heat is absorbed and redistributed on the surface of the Earth through ocean circulation.Activity 5Direction: Cite at least five function or importance of the four subsystems of the earth.1st Quarter Week 1- (Identify common rock – forming minerals using their physical and chemical properties.)Using Characteristics of Minerals to Identify Them Most minerals can be characterized and classified by their unique physical properties: hardness, luster, color, streak, specific gravity, cleavage, fracture, and tenacity.1. HardnessThe ability to resist being scratched—or hardness—is one of the most useful properties for identifying minerals. Hardness is determined by the ability of one mineral to scratch another. Friedrich Mohs, a German mineralogist, produced a hardness scale (table 5) using a set of ten standard minerals. The scale arranges the minerals in order of increasing hardness. Each higher-numbered (harder) mineral will scratch any mineral with a lower number (softer).A rough measure of mineral hardness can be made by assembling a kit of handy objects (table 6). A fingernail has a hardness ranging from 2 to 2.5, a penny is a little harder than 3, window glass ranges from 5.5 to approximately 6 in hardness, and a knife blade is generally in the range of 5 to 6.5.LusterLuster is how a mineral reflects light. The terms metallic and nonmetallic describe the basic types of luster. Table 7 lists the most common terms used to describe luster and an example of a corresponding mineral. Some minerals that don't exhibit luster are referred to as "earthy," "chalky," or "dull."ColorOne of the most obvious properties of a mineral is color. Color should be considered when identifying a mineral, but should never be used as the major identifying characteristic.StreakStreak is the color of the powdered mineral, which is usually more useful for identification than the color of the whole mineral sample. Rubbing the mineral on a streak plate will produce a streak. A streak plate can be made from the unglazed back side of a white porcelain bathroom or kitchen tile. Some minerals won't streak because they are harder than the streak plate.Specific GravitySpecific gravity is the ratio between the mass (weight) of a mineral and the mass (weight) of an equal volume of water. A mineral's specific gravity (SG) can be determined by dividing ​</a>

                                            A rainforest is an area of tall, mostly evergreen trees and a high amount of rainfall. Rainforests are Earth’s oldest living ecosystems, with some surviving in their present form for at least 70 million years. They are incredibly diverse and complex, home to more than half of the world’s plant and animal species—even though they cover just 6% of Earth’s surface. This makes rainforests astoundingly dense with flora and fauna; a 10-square-kilometer (4-square-mile) patch can contain as many as 1,500 flowering plants, 750 species of trees, 400 species of birds and 150 species of butterflies. Rainforests thrive on every continent except Antarctica. The largest rainforests on Earth surround the Amazon River in South America and the Congo River in Africa. The tropical islands of Southeast Asia and parts of Australia support dense rainforest habitats. Even the cool evergreen forests of North America’s Pacific Northwest and Northern Europe are a type of rainforest. Rainforests’ rich biodiversity is incredibly important to our well-being and the well-being of our planet. Rainforests help regulate our climate and provide us with everyday products. Unsustainable industrial and agricultural development, however, has severely degraded the health of the world’s rainforests. Citizens, governments, intergovernmental organizations, and conservation groups are working together to protect these invaluable but fragile ecosystems. Rainforest Structure Most rainforests are structured in four layers: emergent, canopy, understory, and forest floor. Each layer has unique characteristics based on differing levels of water, sunlight, and air circulation. While each layer is distinct, they exist in an interdependent system: processes and species in one layer influence those in another. Emergent Layer The top layer of the rainforest is the emergent layer. Here, trees as tall as 60 meters (200 feet) dominate the skyline. Foliage is often sparse on tree trunks, but spreads wide as the trees reach the sunny upper layer, where they photosynthesize the sun’s rays. Small, waxy leaves help trees in the emergent layer retain water during long droughts or dry seasons. Lightweight seeds are carried away from the parent plant by strong winds. In the Amazon rainforest, the towering trees of the emergent layer include the Brazil nut tree and the kapok tree. The Brazil nut tree, a vulnerable species, can live up to 1,000 years in undisturbed rainforest habitats. Unlike many rainforest species, both the Brazil nut tree and the kapok tree are deciduous—they shed their leaves during the dry season. Animals often maneuver through the emergent layer’s unstable topmost branches by flying or gliding. Animals that can’t fly or glide are usually quite small—they need to be light enough to be supported by a tree’s slender uppermost layers. The animals living in the emergent layer of the Amazon rainforest include birds, bats, gliders, and butterflies. Large raptors, such as white-tailed hawks and harpy eagles, are its top predators. In rainforests on the island of New Guinea, pygmy gliders populate the emergent layer. Pygmy gliders are small rodents that get their name from the way flaps of skin between their legs allow them to glide from branch to branch. Bats are the most diverse mammal species in most tropical rainforests, and they regularly fly throughout the emergent, canopy, and understory layers. One of the world’s largest species of bat, the Madagascan flying fox (found on the African island of Madagascar), for instance, is an important pollinator that mainly feeds on juice from fruit, but will chew flowers for their nectar. Canopy Layer Beneath the emergent layer is the canopy, a deep layer of vegetation roughly 6 meters (20 feet) thick. The canopy’s dense network of leaves and branches forms a roof over the two remaining layers. The canopy blocks winds, rainfall, and sunlight, creating a humid, still, and dark environment below. Trees have adapted to this damp environment by producing glossy leaves with pointed tips that repel water. While trees in the emergent layer rely on wind to scatter their seeds, many canopy plants, lacking wind, encase their seeds in fruit. Sweet fruit entices animals, which eat the fruit and deposit seeds on the forest floor as droppings. Fig trees, common throughout most of the world’s tropical rainforests, may be the most familiar fruit tree in the canopy. With so much food available, more animals live in the canopy than any other layer in the rainforest. The dense vegetation dulls sound, so many—but not all—canopy dwellers are notable for their shrill or frequent vocalizing. In the Amazon rainforest, canopy fruit is snatched up in the large beaks of screeching scarlet macaws and keel-billed toucans, and picked by barking spider and howler monkeys. The silent two-toed sloth chews on the leaves, shoots, and fruit in the canopy. Thousands and thousands of insect species can al​</a>

Use a separate sheet of paper. Note: Use the information below as your reference.INFORMATION ABOUT EARTH’S FOUR SUBSYSTEMS: 1. Definition of a System A set of interconnected components that are interacting to form a unified whole. 2. The Earth system is essentially a closed system. It receives energy from the sun and returns some of this energy to space.3. Atmosphere.A. The atmosphere is the thin gaseous layer that envelopes the lithosphere. B. The present atmosphere is composed of 78% nitrogen (N), 21% oxygen (O2), 0.9% argon, and trace amount of other gases. C. One of the most important processes by which the heat on the Earth's surface is redistributed is through atmospheric circulation. D. There is also a constant exchange of heat and moisture between the atmosphere and thehydrosphere through the hydrologic cycle.4. Lithosphere. A. The lithosphere includes the rocks of the crust and mantle, the metallic liquid outer core, and the solid metallic inner core. B. Briefly discuss the Plate Tectonics as an important process shaping the surface of the Earth. The primary driving mechanism is the Earth's internal heat, such as that in mantle convection.5. Biosphere. A. The biosphere is the set of all life forms on Earth. B. It covers all ecosystems—from the soil to the rainforest, from mangroves to coral reefs, and from the plankton-rich ocean surface to the deep sea. C. For the majority of life on Earth, the base of the food chain comprises photosynthetic organisms. During photosynthesis, CO2 is sequestered from the atmosphere, while oxygen is released as a byproduct. The biosphere is a CO2 sink, and therefore, an important part of the carbon cycle.D. Sunlight is not necessary for life. 6. Hydrosphere. A. About 70% of the Earth is covered with liquid water (hydrosphere) and much of it is in the form of ocean water. B. Only 3% of Earth's water is fresh: two-thirds are in the form of ice, and the remaining one-third is present in streams, lakes, and groundwater.C. The oceans are important sinks for CO2 through direct exchange with the atmosphere and indirectly through the weathering of rocks. D. Heat is absorbed and redistributed on the surface of the Earth through ocean circulation.Activity 5Direction: Cite at least five function or importance of the four subsystems of the earth.1st Quarter Week 1- (Identify common rock – forming minerals using their physical and chemical properties.)Using Characteristics of Minerals to Identify Them Most minerals can be characterized and classified by their unique physical properties: hardness, luster, color, streak, specific gravity, cleavage, fracture, and tenacity.1. HardnessThe ability to resist being scratched—or hardness—is one of the most useful properties for identifying minerals. Hardness is determined by the ability of one mineral to scratch another. Friedrich Mohs, a German mineralogist, produced a hardness scale (table 5) using a set of ten standard minerals. The scale arranges the minerals in order of increasing hardness. Each higher-numbered (harder) mineral will scratch any mineral with a lower number (softer).A rough measure of mineral hardness can be made by assembling a kit of handy objects (table 6). A fingernail has a hardness ranging from 2 to 2.5, a penny is a little harder than 3, window glass ranges from 5.5 to approximately 6 in hardness, and a knife blade is generally in the range of 5 to 6.5.LusterLuster is how a mineral reflects light. The terms metallic and nonmetallic describe the basic types of luster. Table 7 lists the most common terms used to describe luster and an example of a corresponding mineral. Some minerals that don't exhibit luster are referred to as "earthy," "chalky," or "dull."ColorOne of the most obvious properties of a mineral is color. Color should be considered when identifying a mineral, but should never be used as the major identifying characteristic.StreakStreak is the color of the powdered mineral, which is usually more useful for identification than the color of the whole mineral sample. Rubbing the mineral on a streak plate will produce a streak. A streak plate can be made from the unglazed back side of a white porcelain bathroom or kitchen tile. Some minerals won't streak because they are harder than the streak plate.Specific GravitySpecific gravity is the ratio between the mass (weight) of a mineral and the mass (weight) of an equal volume of water. A mineral's specific gravity (SG) can be determined by dividing ​</a>

HardnessThe ability to resist being scratched—or hardness—is one of the most useful properties for identifying minerals. Hardness is determined by the ability of one mineral to scratch another. Friedrich Mohs, a German mineralogist, produced a hardness scale (table 5) using a set of ten standard minerals. The scale arranges the minerals in order of increasing hardness. Each higher-numbered (harder) mineral will scratch any mineral with a lower number (softer).A rough measure of mineral hardness can be made by assembling a kit of handy objects (table 6). A fingernail has a hardness ranging from 2 to 2.5, a penny is a little harder than 3, window glass ranges from 5.5 to approximately 6 in hardness, and a knife blade is generally in the range of 5 to 6.5.LusterLuster is how a mineral reflects light. The terms metallic and nonmetallic describe the basic types of luster. Table 7 lists the most common terms used to describe luster and an example of a corresponding mineral. Some minerals that don't exhibit luster are referred to as "earthy," "chalky," or "dull."ColorOne of the most obvious properties of a mineral is color. Color should be considered when identifying a mineral, but should never be used as the major identifying characteristic.StreakStreak is the color of the powdered mineral, which is usually more useful for identification than the color of the whole mineral sample. Rubbing the mineral on a streak plate will produce a streak. A streak plate can be made from the unglazed back side of a white porcelain bathroom or kitchen tile. Some minerals won't streak because they are harder than the streak plate.Specific GravitySpecific gravity is the ratio between the mass (weight) of a mineral and the mass (weight) of an equal volume of water. A mineral's specific gravity (SG) can be determined by dividing ​</h2><br />

                            7. A rainforest is an area of tall, mostly evergreen trees and a high amount of rainfall. Rainforests are Earth’s oldest living ecosystems, with some surviving in their present form for at least 70 million years. They are incredibly diverse and complex, home to more than half of the world’s plant and animal species—even though they cover just 6% of Earth’s surface. This makes rainforests astoundingly dense with flora and fauna; a 10-square-kilometer (4-square-mile) patch can contain as many as 1,500 flowering plants, 750 species of trees, 400 species of birds and 150 species of butterflies. Rainforests thrive on every continent except Antarctica. The largest rainforests on Earth surround the Amazon River in South America and the Congo River in Africa. The tropical islands of Southeast Asia and parts of Australia support dense rainforest habitats. Even the cool evergreen forests of North America’s Pacific Northwest and Northern Europe are a type of rainforest. Rainforests’ rich biodiversity is incredibly important to our well-being and the well-being of our planet. Rainforests help regulate our climate and provide us with everyday products. Unsustainable industrial and agricultural development, however, has severely degraded the health of the world’s rainforests. Citizens, governments, intergovernmental organizations, and conservation groups are working together to protect these invaluable but fragile ecosystems. Rainforest Structure Most rainforests are structured in four layers: emergent, canopy, understory, and forest floor. Each layer has unique characteristics based on differing levels of water, sunlight, and air circulation. While each layer is distinct, they exist in an interdependent system: processes and species in one layer influence those in another. Emergent Layer The top layer of the rainforest is the emergent layer. Here, trees as tall as 60 meters (200 feet) dominate the skyline. Foliage is often sparse on tree trunks, but spreads wide as the trees reach the sunny upper layer, where they photosynthesize the sun’s rays. Small, waxy leaves help trees in the emergent layer retain water during long droughts or dry seasons. Lightweight seeds are carried away from the parent plant by strong winds. In the Amazon rainforest, the towering trees of the emergent layer include the Brazil nut tree and the kapok tree. The Brazil nut tree, a vulnerable species, can live up to 1,000 years in undisturbed rainforest habitats. Unlike many rainforest species, both the Brazil nut tree and the kapok tree are deciduous—they shed their leaves during the dry season. Animals often maneuver through the emergent layer’s unstable topmost branches by flying or gliding. Animals that can’t fly or glide are usually quite small—they need to be light enough to be supported by a tree’s slender uppermost layers. The animals living in the emergent layer of the Amazon rainforest include birds, bats, gliders, and butterflies. Large raptors, such as white-tailed hawks and harpy eagles, are its top predators. In rainforests on the island of New Guinea, pygmy gliders populate the emergent layer. Pygmy gliders are small rodents that get their name from the way flaps of skin between their legs allow them to glide from branch to branch. Bats are the most diverse mammal species in most tropical rainforests, and they regularly fly throughout the emergent, canopy, and understory layers. One of the world’s largest species of bat, the Madagascan flying fox (found on the African island of Madagascar), for instance, is an important pollinator that mainly feeds on juice from fruit, but will chew flowers for their nectar. Canopy Layer Beneath the emergent layer is the canopy, a deep layer of vegetation roughly 6 meters (20 feet) thick. The canopy’s dense network of leaves and branches forms a roof over the two remaining layers. The canopy blocks winds, rainfall, and sunlight, creating a humid, still, and dark environment below. Trees have adapted to this damp environment by producing glossy leaves with pointed tips that repel water. While trees in the emergent layer rely on wind to scatter their seeds, many canopy plants, lacking wind, encase their seeds in fruit. Sweet fruit entices animals, which eat the fruit and deposit seeds on the forest floor as droppings. Fig trees, common throughout most of the world’s tropical rainforests, may be the most familiar fruit tree in the canopy. With so much food available, more animals live in the canopy than any other layer in the rainforest. The dense vegetation dulls sound, so many—but not all—canopy dwellers are notable for their shrill or frequent vocalizing. In the Amazon rainforest, canopy fruit is snatched up in the large beaks of screeching scarlet macaws and keel-billed toucans, and picked by barking spider and howler monkeys. The silent two-toed sloth chews on the leaves, shoots, and fruit in the canopy. Thousands and thousands of insect species can al​</h2><br />
