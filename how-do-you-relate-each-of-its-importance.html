The diagrams below illustrate several important properties of gravitational force. In each picture, the sizes of tñe arrows are proportional to the size of the forces between the objects. Assume that the larger the size of the object, the larger its mass. Study the diagrams. Then, answer the questions. A. С () B. C. ( ) O LOADS 1. Look at Figures A and B. What is the same in both pictures? 2. How do Figures A and B differ? 3. What important property of gravitational force is illustrated by Figures A and B? 4. Look at Figure C. How are the three pairs of objects different? 5. What property of gravitational force is illustrated by Figure C? 6. How do the two objects in Figure D differ from each other? 7. What does Figure D tell you about gravitational force? 8. Which diagram is most like the situation that exists when an apple falls to the ground? Why?​</a>

                                            Directions: Read and reflect on the short essay then answer the guide questions on a separate sheet of paper.          Man as a Social Animal        By Ma. Teresa B. Berondo   "Man is by nature a social animal." This is a famous line by Aristotle, a well-known ancient philosopher. What does it mean? Do we take its meaning literally? Or does it have a deeper meaning beyond the actual words? Since the human being is considered the highest form of animal, it can literally mean that man by nature is armored with mechanisms like language and reason that he uses to interact with others. In a deeper sense, human beings cannot exist in this world alone. People want the company of others to feel the love and care that they need. This feeling of closeness can be found in our own family, close friends, and personal relationships. Also, people form a social group with common interest and similar perspectives in life despite their differences in terms of personality, behavior, family background and other personal qualities. As human beings form social www.shsph.blogspot.com groups, they create social relation with others that are mutually beneficial to each other. This makes them engage in common aspirations and support each other's beliefs. As man gets together and interacts with one another based on relationships, common identity, and culture, man is indeed a social animal. Think About This! 1. Do you believe that man is a social animal? Why or why not? 2. How does man becomes a social animal based on the essay? 3. How important is human interaction in building the nation?​</a>

How do we navigate through the uncertainties posed by our time? The simple truth is that there are no ready-made answers for this question. None of us have gone through ma before. No one realy 100-percent ready for what comes next What I can say, however, is that I myself have gone through periods of uncertainty And my experiences have taught me to be at peace with the act of stepping into the unknown by anchoring mysed on two things looking outward and moving forward Look beyond ourselves names of cra, many will feel the urge to think only of ones to founder, and o retreat in cur anal comes of comfort.

PLEASE INFORM YOUR GRADE 7 SCHOOLMATES-(friends, neighbors etc) Reacting to assertions in a text Your reaction to what you are reading is called a text response. A text response is basically sharing your reaction to a writen text. It is an opportunity to let others know how you feel a bout the book or any text that you have read. It can also be called a reader response. Below are some points that can help you write your response [ ] How do you feel about what you are reading? [ ] What do you agree or disagree with? [ ] Can you identify with the situation? [ ] What would be the best way to evaluate the story? In writing a response, it is important to do the following: 1. Read the text for understanding 2. Write the response in a three-part structure (introduction, body, conclusion) 3. Use statements that express reaction (l felt that . . . In my opinion The author seems to .. . , etc.) FACT AND OPINION With the influx of information courtesy of the internet, one can easily drown in the sea of endless details if he or she is not too keen on distinguising facts from opinions.

Berondo   "Man is by nature a social animal." This is a famous line by Aristotle, a well-known ancient philosopher. What does it mean? Do we take its meaning literally? Or does it have a deeper meaning beyond the actual words? Since the human being is considered the highest form of animal, it can literally mean that man by nature is armored with mechanisms like language and reason that he uses to interact with others. In a deeper sense, human beings cannot exist in this world alone. People want the company of others to feel the love and care that they need. This feeling of closeness can be found in our own family, close friends, and personal relationships. Also, people form a social group with common interest and similar perspectives in life despite their differences in terms of personality, behavior, family background and other personal qualities. As human beings form social www.shsph.blogspot.com groups, they create social relation with others that are mutually beneficial to each other. This makes them engage in common aspirations and support each other's beliefs. As man gets together and interacts with one another based on relationships, common identity, and culture, man is indeed a social animal. Think About This! 1. Do you believe that man is a social animal? Why or why not? 2. How does man becomes a social animal based on the essay? 3. How important is human interaction in building the nation?​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p></p><p>1. Yes, I believe that man is a social animal because humans have a natural instinct to live in society with other human beings.</p><p></p><p>2. Man becomes a social animal by forming social groups with common interests and similar perspectives in life despite their differences in terms of personality, behavior, family background, and other personal qualities.</p><p></p><p>3. Human interaction is very important in building a nation because it helps people form social groups that can work together towards common goals.</p><p></p><br />

Many of you must feel robbed as we are al stuck in our homes forced to deal with at that is happening from a distance The pandemic has brought our lives to a halt like nothing else could competing to imagine our world anew. How do we navigate through the uncertainties posed by our time? The simple truth is that there are no ready-made answers for this question. None of us have gone through ma before. No one realy 100-percent ready for what comes next What I can say, however, is that I myself have gone through periods of uncertainty And my experiences have taught me to be at peace with the act of stepping into the unknown by anchoring mysed on two things looking outward and moving forward Look beyond ourselves names of cra, many will feel the urge to think only of ones to founder, and o retreat in cur anal comes of comfort. When the fateful plane crash took the life of my husband. Jesse, it turned my whole world and those of my children upside down But the way the nation grieved with us and the impact of the legacy Jesse left behind plucked me out of the shadows I realized that there are things greater than ourselves and that there are causes that will always be worth fighting for no matter Ilamed that shing back into our bubbles, allowing fear and get to paralyze us only leads in deeper despair.
