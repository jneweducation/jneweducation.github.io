                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>I'm sorry, but as an AI language model, I am unable to create visual content such as diagrams or images. However, I can provide a verbal explanation of how to solve the problems you have presented.</p><p></p><p>Day 1:</p><p></p><p>To find the surface area of the figure, we need to first draw the net, which is the unfolded or flattened version of the 3D figure. From the given information, we know that the figure consists of a rectangular door, a circular attic window, and two rectangular windows.</p><p></p><p>To draw the net, we need to imagine the figure flattened out into a 2D shape. We can start with the rectangular door, which has dimensions of 3 meters by 1.5 meters. We can draw a rectangle with these dimensions and label it as the door.</p><p></p><p>Next, we can draw the circular attic window, which has a radius of 2 feet. We can draw a circle with a diameter of 4 feet and label it as the attic window.</p><p></p><p>Finally, we can draw the two rectangular windows, which have dimensions of 2 meters by 1.5 meters. We can draw two rectangles with these dimensions and label them as the windows.</p><p></p><p>Once we have drawn the net, we can calculate the surface area by finding the area of each face and adding them together. The rectangular door has an area of 3 meters by 1.5 meters, or 4.5 square meters. The circular attic window has an area of pi times the radius squared, or pi times 2 squared, which is approximately 12.57 square feet. The two rectangular windows have an area of 2 meters by 1.5 meters, or 3 square meters each.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, the total surface area of the figure is approximately 23.57 square meters.</p><p></p><p>Day 2 and 3:</p><p></p><p>To create a house representing different polygons, we can start by choosing a polygon for each face of the house. For example, we could choose a rectangle for the front wall, a triangle for the roof, and a trapezoid for the back wall.</p><p></p><p>Once we have chosen the polygons, we can draw them to scale and label the dimensions. We can then find the area of each face by using the appropriate formula for each polygon. For example, the area of a rectangle is length times width, the area of a triangle is base times height divided by 2, and the area of a trapezoid is the average of the bases times the height.</p><p></p><p>Once we have found the area of each face, we can add them together to find the total surface area of the house.</p><p></p><p>Day 4 and 5:</p><p></p><p>To create two examples of solid figures using materials available at home, we can start by choosing the type of material we want to use, such as paper, cardboard, or clay. We can then choose a shape for each figure, such as a cylinder, pyramid, or cube.</p><p></p><p>Once we have chosen the shapes, we can create them using the materials available. For example, we could create a cylinder by rolling up a piece of paper or cardboard and taping the edges together. We could create a pyramid by cutting and folding paper or cardboard into the appropriate shape and gluing the edges together. We could create a cube by cutting and folding paper or cardboard into a square and gluing the edges together.</p><p></p><p>Once we have created the figures, we can find their surface area by using the appropriate formula for each shape. For example, the surface area of a cylinder is 2 times pi times the radius times the height plus 2 times pi times the radius squared. The surface area of a pyramid is the sum of the area of the base plus the area of each triangular face. The surface area of a cube is 6 times the length times the width.</p><p></p><p>PA BRAINLEST AND FOLLOW PO</p><br />
