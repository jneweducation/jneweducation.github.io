The building up of gases in the Earth’s atmosphere causes the greenhouse effect. With so much gas in the atmosphere, the Earth becomes like a greenhouse because heat from the surface cannot easily escape into outer space. Global warming occurs because of the gases that block the heat from escaping to outer space. Hence, the temperature of the Earth rises. --------2. Materials can be grouped into biodegradable and nonbiodegradable. Materials that rot and decay are known as biodegradable. The decaying process takes place with the help of bacteria and fungi, which are known as decomposers. Materials that do not decay are known as nonbiodegradable. These materials can clog drainage and can cause water and land pollution._______3. One afternoon, Emmanuel’s class adviser handed him a letter sealed in a small envelope and told him to give it to his parents. The boy went home and gave the envelope to his mother. His mother read the letter. Emmanuel was qualified for a full scholarship next school year in one of the prestigious schools in their town. His mother’s eyes welled up with tears of joy._________4. The Hertzsprung – Russel Diagram shows the three different types of stars. The first type is called the Main Sequence, which includes the sun. The stars are fueled by nuclear fusion, converting hydrogen into helium. The hotter they are, the brighter they become. They last for about five billion years. The second type includes the super giants. As they reach old age, they deplete their hydrogen supply. Their core contracts as their outer layers expand. Eventually, they will explode, becoming nebula or supernova, then white dwarfs, neutron stars, or black holes. The third type, smaller stars, consequently become white dwarfs, shrinking and depleting their nuclear fuels, finally becoming cold, dark, black dwarfs._________5. Pollination is the process by which pollen grains are transferred from one anther to the stigma of a flower. Pollination is classified self-pollination and cross-pollination. Self-pollination happens if the transfer of pollen grains occurs in the same flower. Cross-pollination occurs if the transfer is from the anther of one flower to the stigma of another flower of the same kind.II. A.

The building up of gases in the Earth’s atmosphere causes the greenhouse effect. With so much gas in the atmosphere, the Earth becomes like a greenhouse because heat from the surface cannot easily escape into outer space. Global warming occurs because of the gases that block the heat from escaping to outer space. Hence, the temperature of the Earth rises. --------2.

The Hertzsprung – Russel Diagram shows the three different types of stars. The first type is called the Main Sequence, which includes the sun. The stars are fueled by nuclear fusion, converting hydrogen into helium. The hotter they are, the brighter they become. They last for about five billion years. The second type includes the super giants. As they reach old age, they deplete their hydrogen supply. Their core contracts as their outer layers expand. Eventually, they will explode, becoming nebula or supernova, then white dwarfs, neutron stars, or black holes. The third type, smaller stars, consequently become white dwarfs, shrinking and depleting their nuclear fuels, finally becoming cold, dark, black dwarfs._________5. Pollination is the process by which pollen grains are transferred from one anther to the stigma of a flower. Pollination is classified self-pollination and cross-pollination. Self-pollination happens if the transfer of pollen grains occurs in the same flower. Cross-pollination occurs if the transfer is from the anther of one flower to the stigma of another flower of the same kind.II. A.

The building up of gases in the Earth’s atmosphere causes the greenhouse effect. With so much gas in the atmosphere, the Earth becomes like a greenhouse because heat from the surface cannot easily escape into outer space. Global warming occurs because of the gases that block the heat from escaping to outer space. Hence, the temperature of the Earth rises. --------2. Materials can be grouped into biodegradable and nonbiodegradable. Materials that rot and decay are known as biodegradable. The decaying process takes place with the help of bacteria and fungi, which are known as decomposers. Materials that do not decay are known as nonbiodegradable. These materials can clog drainage and can cause water and land pollution._______3. One afternoon, Emmanuel’s class adviser handed him a letter sealed in a small envelope and told him to give it to his parents. The boy went home and gave the envelope to his mother. His mother read the letter. Emmanuel was qualified for a full scholarship next school year in one of the prestigious schools in their town. His mother’s eyes welled up with tears of joy._________4. The Hertzsprung – Russel Diagram shows the three different types of stars. The first type is called the Main Sequence, which includes the sun. The stars are fueled by nuclear fusion, converting hydrogen into helium. The hotter they are, the brighter they become. They last for about five billion years. The second type includes the super giants. As they reach old age, they deplete their hydrogen supply. Their core contracts as their outer layers expand. Eventually, they will explode, becoming nebula or supernova, then white dwarfs, neutron stars, or black holes. The third type, smaller stars, consequently become white dwarfs, shrinking and depleting their nuclear fuels, finally becoming cold, dark, black dwarfs._________5. Pollination is the process by which pollen grains are transferred from one anther to the stigma of a flower. Pollination is classified self-pollination and cross-pollination. Self-pollination happens if the transfer of pollen grains occurs in the same flower. Cross-pollination occurs if the transfer is from the anther of one flower to the stigma of another flower of the same kind.II. A.

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p></p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>The current president had his priorities wrong when the virus was ravaging the country. It was in the middle of January 2020 when COVID -19 cases started sprouting near Asia. During that time, there is a massive knowledge of mainland Chinese migrating in the country for work and tourism and he did not place a travel ban as not to stress his friendship with the country. When the first case was recorded in the country, he belittled it, dismissed and joked about it as if it is not threatening to the public. Even when the cases are multiplying, there was no sense of urgency.  </p><p>He placed a national lockdown but there were a lot of oversights especially when addressing the problems of the public caused by the lockdown like transportation, mass testing, and jobs. His policies are not affecting the people who may be in advantage but not the majority makeup of the Filipino population who are not privileged enough. The barangay officials and Local Government Units themselves are complaining for lack of foresight. Because of Duterte’s lack of leadership and urgency, local politicians are forced to have their own policies to protect their constituents.  </p><p>
</p><p>Lastly,  the president is given emergency powers and mounting foreign debt at his disposal to ease the lives of the Filipinos during this time of pandemic, but he redirected those to closing a network franchise, expediting an anti-terror bill, and reconstructing a fake beach.  </p><p></p><p>#BrainlyFast</p><p>https://brainly.ph/question/22410898</p><br />

The building up of gases in the Earth’s atmosphere causes the greenhouse effect. With so much gas in the atmosphere, the Earth becomes like a greenhouse because heat from the surface cannot easily escape into outer space. Global warming occurs because of the gases that block the heat from escaping to outer space. Hence, the temperature of the Earth rises. --------2. Materials can be grouped into biodegradable and nonbiodegradable. Materials that rot and decay are known as biodegradable. The decaying process takes place with the help of bacteria and fungi, which are known as decomposers. Materials that do not decay are known as nonbiodegradable. These materials can clog drainage and can cause water and land pollution._______3.

His mother read the letter. Emmanuel was qualified for a full scholarship next school year in one of the prestigious schools in their town. His mother’s eyes welled up with tears of joy._________4. The Hertzsprung – Russel Diagram shows the three different types of stars. The first type is called the Main Sequence, which includes the sun. The stars are fueled by nuclear fusion, converting hydrogen into helium. The hotter they are, the brighter they become. They last for about five billion years. The second type includes the super giants. As they reach old age, they deplete their hydrogen supply. Their core contracts as their outer layers expand. Eventually, they will explode, becoming nebula or supernova, then white dwarfs, neutron stars, or black holes. The third type, smaller stars, consequently become white dwarfs, shrinking and depleting their nuclear fuels, finally becoming cold, dark, black dwarfs._________5. Pollination is the process by which pollen grains are transferred from one anther to the stigma of a flower. Pollination is classified self-pollination and cross-pollination. Self-pollination happens if the transfer of pollen grains occurs in the same flower. Cross-pollination occurs if the transfer is from the anther of one flower to the stigma of another flower of the same kind.II. A.
