                                            When I was ten years old, my best friend Linda's father died. We knew he had been
very sick, but Linda told us nothing else about his illness. When you are ten, the death
of someone close to you is usually too frightening to talk about. Linda's friends would
never have dreamed of asking, "What did your daddy die of?"
Although she moved to another city when we were both 13, I kept in touch with
Linda. When she was twenty, she told me that her brother Peter was ill. Peter was 31,
married, and had a two-year-old daughter. Over the next three years, I learned from
Linda that his condition had gotten much worse, and he had been confined to a
hospital. A year later Linda wrote to tell me that he had died and that her unmarried
sister Hope, then 33, was showing early signs of the same disease that had taken the
lives of her father and brother.
Linda disclosed in that letter that her father, Peter, and now Hope were victims of
Huntington's Disease. She explained that it is a genetic disease caused by an
autosomal dominant gene. Anyone who inherits the gene will suffer physical and
mental deterioration, usually beginning about age forty. Symptoms from the most
lethal form of the gene can sometimes begin several years earlier. The disease begins
by causing a variety of physical symptoms. The victim loses muscular control, soon
becoming unable to walk normally or do tasks requiring any coordinated motion.
Speech becomes difficult and then impossible. Within a few years, a serious mental
disturbance occurs followed inevitably by death. There is no cure, no effective
treatment for the disease.
One purpose of Linda's letter was to seek my advice. She faces a very difficult
decision. Genetic research has identified the form of the gene that causes Huntington's
disease. A test has been developed in which the gene is cloned, and DNA analysis can
be done to determine if a person is carrying the lethal allele. Linda is now 24 and she
has fallen in love. She knows there is a 50% chance that she inherited the lethal gene
from her father. The question she has asked me to help her with is should she have the
test done to find out whether or not she is doomed to suffer the same fate as her father,
brother, and sister?</a>

If a shark Loses a tooth, another moves forword from within the shark's jaw, where it keeps a nearly unlimited supply of replacement teeth. This way, it's almost impossible for a shark to end up w/o a full set of teeth. This is a phenomenon unique to the shark. No other animal in the world has teeth quite like the Shark's. A shark can go through as many as 20,000 teeth in it's lifetime! TOPIC: MAIN IDEA:​</a>

                                            That evening Alexa complained to her parents. Her mom was outrageous that the Director/Choreographer did not include her daughter in the team But Alexa's father suggested the maybe the Director/Choreographer had a point. Alexa went upstairs stormed in a huff and slammed the door of the room. Leaving the parents on the living room while having a big argument. Alexa couldn't sleep that night. She is planning to ignore the girls as well as the Director/choreographer starting tomorrow. The school team would probably lose this yearl And, it the dance choreographer's fault, for not picking her! Yet, in as much as she tried to stay away from the dance studio, she could not stay away with it because it is her passion! So, she still practiced every day, careful to stay out of the team's way. At first, she felt satisfied to see the girls on the team struggling. But then it started to bother her for a different reason. One day, after watching lea do the routine repeatedly unperfect. She approached Lea and explained what she must do to do it nicely. Lea did as Alexa suggested, and immediately show some improvements. Alexa felt good inside as she went on with her practice -alone and lonely. She didn't notice the Choreographer across the room, watching her. Over the next few weeks, If Alexa had an opportunity to help on of the girls, she did it without expecting anything. She no longer thinking of joining the team. She just worked hard day after day, for hours, pushing her limits harder and harder. The dance team competed again and again and each time the girls did a little bit of improvement. Once, they even won the contest! "We couldn't have done this without Alexa's help," the girls said to one another in their locker room. The following year, Alexa tried out for the dance team again. This time, when the girls cheered her, she did a good job, she just thanked them, and sit back silently. When the choreographer posted the list on bulletin board, Alexa approached with apprehension. She was sure the Choreographer much hate her and she is not expecting her name to be appeared on the list. But there was her name, on the list! Her hard work had paid-off- but not the hard work she had put in learning complicated dance moves. When she showed up for the practice the following day, the choreographer smiled at her, she knew it was the hard work of becoming a better team player that was responsible for her success. a Let Us Practice: A. Answer the following questions, briefly. 1. Who are the characters in the story? 2. Where did the story happened? 3. What is the first big event that happened in the story? 4. What comes next after Alexa find out that she is not included in the team? 5. Did she truly ignore the rest of the team, since then? Why? 6. If you were Alexa, will you still try your luck even though the choreographer does not like you, as a person? 7. Can you identify the climax of the story? What is it?​</a>

                                            increasing hand eye coordination and increasing dexterity mental skills; a decrease interest inother interest such as studies and sports; and a very negative effect of inducing violence.One of the most positive effects of video games is increasing the dexterity of a child andimproving his or her hand eye coordination. As mentioned earlier, the new video games that arecoming out are extremely complex and they involve the movement of many different kinds ofsticks and buttons on the controllers. These can be very good for children as they learn to makethe fast connections between what they see and what their hands and fingers are doing. Thisallows them to think quickly and improves their reflexes. The newest games are very precision-based and it takes very minute and accurate movements for the children to control thecharacters. This helps in making the children much more a depth at handling and operating real-life machinery and objectives.Another effect that playing video games have on children is that they tend to get addictedto playing this games and give them foremost priority. This takes the children away from theirother responsibilities, such as doing house chores, homework, and other physical activities.Children also end at spending more time playing video games in front of television screens thanplaying real and actual sports that involve physical exercise. This in turn can have many healthrelated problems for children, as they can get obese if they don't exercise ad stay home playingvideo games. This is perhaps the worst negative effect that video games can have on children.Parents and educators all over the world are concern about this phenomenon and they areurging the children to not spend so much time playing video games. Many new video gamesconsuls, such as the new Nintendo WII have come out with games that require users to actuallyget up and move.Many researchers have talk about the effects of viewing violence in the media and how itaffects children. Video games takes this to another level, where the children are actuallyparticipating in being violent in the video games. There are many games out there that allowchildren to play arm bearing characters who can kill anyone that they want, steal cars, andcommit many different kinds of crime. These games can have negative implications on thechildren as they get immune to the idea of committing crime and end up believing that it isalrighi. Research still on going on this negative effect and it has not entirely been proven ordisproven as of yet.We find that plain video games can have various effects on children, both positive as wellas negative. Even though children can benefit by increasing their dexterity and improving theirreflexes. The cost of them losing out on their physical exercise and homework, as well as theirbecoming prone to violent acts, are way too much. It is important that the parents and educatorstakeup this problem seriously and enable certain rules and regulations that allow children todivide their time responsively between playing video games and completing their studies andother responsibilities.- (Source: www.tailoredessays.com/samples/video-games-affect-children-essay.htm)1.

                            4. When I was ten years old, my best friend Linda's father died. We knew he had been
very sick, but Linda told us nothing else about his illness. When you are ten, the death
of someone close to you is usually too frightening to talk about. Linda's friends would
never have dreamed of asking, "What did your daddy die of?"
Although she moved to another city when we were both 13, I kept in touch with
Linda. When she was twenty, she told me that her brother Peter was ill. Peter was 31,
married, and had a two-year-old daughter. Over the next three years, I learned from
Linda that his condition had gotten much worse, and he had been confined to a
hospital. A year later Linda wrote to tell me that he had died and that her unmarried
sister Hope, then 33, was showing early signs of the same disease that had taken the
lives of her father and brother.
Linda disclosed in that letter that her father, Peter, and now Hope were victims of
Huntington's Disease. She explained that it is a genetic disease caused by an
autosomal dominant gene. Anyone who inherits the gene will suffer physical and
mental deterioration, usually beginning about age forty. Symptoms from the most
lethal form of the gene can sometimes begin several years earlier. The disease begins
by causing a variety of physical symptoms. The victim loses muscular control, soon
becoming unable to walk normally or do tasks requiring any coordinated motion.
Speech becomes difficult and then impossible. Within a few years, a serious mental
disturbance occurs followed inevitably by death. There is no cure, no effective
treatment for the disease.
One purpose of Linda's letter was to seek my advice. She faces a very difficult
decision. Genetic research has identified the form of the gene that causes Huntington's
disease. A test has been developed in which the gene is cloned, and DNA analysis can
be done to determine if a person is carrying the lethal allele. Linda is now 24 and she
has fallen in love. She knows there is a 50% chance that she inherited the lethal gene
from her father. The question she has asked me to help her with is should she have the
test done to find out whether or not she is doomed to suffer the same fate as her father,
brother, and sister?</h2><br />

</p><p>test done to find out whether or not she is doo_med to suffer the same fate as her father,  brother, and sister?</p><p></p><p>- I personally think that Linda should do the test. I know it can be frightening because she's dealing with life and de_ath but the thought about her possible situation would always bother her.   I believe that she must ready herself before taking the test and already reflected on how she would deal with the possible results. Truth is always connected with peace of mind.</p><p></p><p>#BRAINLYFAST!</p><p><strong></strong></p><p></p><br />

Alexa went upstairs stormed in a huff and slammed the door of the room. Leaving the parents on the living room while having a big argument. Alexa couldn't sleep that night. She is planning to ignore the girls as well as the Director/choreographer starting tomorrow. The school team would probably lose this yearl And, it the dance choreographer's fault, for not picking her! Yet, in as much as she tried to stay away from the dance studio, she could not stay away with it because it is her passion! So, she still practiced every day, careful to stay out of the team's way. At first, she felt satisfied to see the girls on the team struggling. But then it started to bother her for a different reason. One day, after watching lea do the routine repeatedly unperfect. She approached Lea and explained what she must do to do it nicely. Lea did as Alexa suggested, and immediately show some improvements. Alexa felt good inside as she went on with her practice -alone and lonely. She didn't notice the Choreographer across the room, watching her. Over the next few weeks, If Alexa had an opportunity to help on of the girls, she did it without expecting anything. She no longer thinking of joining the team. She just worked hard day after day, for hours, pushing her limits harder and harder. The dance team competed again and again and each time the girls did a little bit of improvement. Once, they even won the contest! "We couldn't have done this without Alexa's help," the girls said to one another in their locker room. The following year, Alexa tried out for the dance team again. This time, when the girls cheered her, she did a good job, she just thanked them, and sit back silently. When the choreographer posted the list on bulletin board, Alexa approached with apprehension. She was sure the Choreographer much hate her and she is not expecting her name to be appeared on the list. But there was her name, on the list! Her hard work had paid-off- but not the hard work she had put in learning complicated dance moves. When she showed up for the practice the following day, the choreographer smiled at her, she knew it was the hard work of becoming a better team player that was responsible for her success. a Let Us Practice: A. Answer the following questions, briefly. 1. Who are the characters in the story? 2. Where did the story happened? 3. What is the first big event that happened in the story? 4.

These can be very good for children as they learn to makethe fast connections between what they see and what their hands and fingers are doing. Thisallows them to think quickly and improves their reflexes. The newest games are very precision-based and it takes very minute and accurate movements for the children to control thecharacters. This helps in making the children much more a depth at handling and operating real-life machinery and objectives.Another effect that playing video games have on children is that they tend to get addictedto playing this games and give them foremost priority. This takes the children away from theirother responsibilities, such as doing house chores, homework, and other physical activities.Children also end at spending more time playing video games in front of television screens thanplaying real and actual sports that involve physical exercise. This in turn can have many healthrelated problems for children, as they can get obese if they don't exercise ad stay home playingvideo games. This is perhaps the worst negative effect that video games can have on children.Parents and educators all over the world are concern about this phenomenon and they areurging the children to not spend so much time playing video games. Many new video gamesconsuls, such as the new Nintendo WII have come out with games that require users to actuallyget up and move.Many researchers have talk about the effects of viewing violence in the media and how itaffects children. Video games takes this to another level, where the children are actuallyparticipating in being violent in the video games. There are many games out there that allowchildren to play arm bearing characters who can kill anyone that they want, steal cars, andcommit many different kinds of crime. These games can have negative implications on thechildren as they get immune to the idea of committing crime and end up believing that it isalrighi. Research still on going on this negative effect and it has not entirely been proven ordisproven as of yet.We find that plain video games can have various effects on children, both positive as wellas negative. Even though children can benefit by increasing their dexterity and improving theirreflexes. The cost of them losing out on their physical exercise and homework, as well as theirbecoming prone to violent acts, are way too much. It is important that the parents and educatorstakeup this problem seriously and enable certain rules and regulations that allow children todivide their time responsively between playing video games and completing their studies andother responsibilities.- (Source: www.tailoredessays.com/samples/video-games-affect-children-essay.htm)1.
