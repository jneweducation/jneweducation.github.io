                        <p> <strong>1</strong><strong>0</strong><strong> </strong><strong>ways to </strong><strong>f</strong><strong>all asleep naturally</strong></p><p> </p><p>Having a consistent sleeping pattern may help a person fall asleep more quickly.</p><p>Many people who struggle with sleep lie in bed wondering how to fall asleep. When this happens, try using the tips below. Some are long-term lifestyle changes, while others are short-term solutions to try in the moment.</p><p></p><p>1. Create a consistent sleeping pattern</p><p>Going to bed at different times every night is a common habit for many people. However, these irregular sleeping patterns could interfere with sleep because they interrupt the body’s circadian rhythm.</p><p></p><p>The circadian rhythm is a selection of behavioral, physical, and mental changes that follow a 24-hour cycle. A primary function of the circadian rhythm is to determine whether the body is ready for sleep or not.</p><p></p><p>This is heavily influenced by a biological clock that releases hormones to induce sleep or wakefulness. Going to bed at the same time every night helps the body clock predict when to induce sleep.</p><p></p><p>Learn more about the best time to sleep and wake up here.</p><p></p><p>2. Keep the lights off</p><p>Cues such as light also influence the circadian rhythm, which helps the brain and body judge when it is nighttime. Keeping the room as dark as possible when going to bed might help bring on sleep.</p><p></p><p>3. Avoid napping during the day</p><p>Taking naps during the daytime, particularly those that last longer than 2 hours, can also disrupt the circadian rhythm.</p><p></p><p>One studyTrusted Source found that college students who napped at least three times per week and those who napped for longer than 2 hours each time had lower sleep quality than their peers who did not.</p><p></p><p>After a poor night’s sleep, it is tempting to take a long nap. However, try to avoid this, as it can adversely affect a healthful sleep cycle.</p><p></p><p>Learn about the ideal nap length here.</p><p></p><p>4. Get some exercise during the day</p><p>Physical exercise has a positive impact on sleep quality.</p><p></p><p>One review that looked at 305 people over 40 years old with sleeping difficulties found that moderate or high intensity exercise programs led to improvements in sleep quality. The study also found that participants took their sleep medication less frequently while participating in an exercise program.</p><p></p><p>It is currently unclear whether or not exercising at different times of day has an impact on sleep.</p><p></p><p>When taking on an exercise routine, it can be difficult to know where to start. Learn more here.</p><p></p><p>5. Avoid using your cell phone</p><p>Currently, there is much debate about whether or not the use of cell phones at bedtime affects sleep.</p><p></p><p>One study in college students found that those who scored high on a scale of problem phone use, such as addictive texting behavior, had a lower sleep quality. However, there was no difference in the length of time they slept.</p><p></p><p>Much of the current research is in students and young people, so it is unclear whether or not these findings extend to other age groups. Studies also tend to focus on problem phone use. People who do not use their phone in this way may not be as susceptible to sleep disturbances.</p><p></p><p>More research is necessary in this area to understand the extent to which phone use can impact sleep.</p><p></p><p>6. Read a book</p><p>Reading books can be relaxing and may help prevent anxious thought patterns that could interfere with a person’s sleep. However, it is best to avoid books that might cause strong emotional responses.</p><p></p><p>7. Avoid caffeine</p><p>Caffeine is a stimulant. It stimulates wakefulness and can disrupt sleep patterns. Therefore, it is best to avoid caffeine for at least 4 hours before going to bed.</p><p></p><p>In some people, consuming caffeine at any time of the day could have a negative impact on sleep quality. For these people, it may be best to avoid caffeine altogether.</p><p></p><p>8. Try meditation or mindfulness</p><p>Meditation and mindfulness can help reduce anxiety, which often disrupts sleep. Using these techniques can help calm an anxious mind, distracting the person from busy thoughts and allowing them to fall asleep more easily.</p><p></p><p>A studyTrusted Source in older adults with sleeping difficulties found that mindfulness meditation improved sleep quality, compared with people who did not practice mindfulness.</p><p></p><p>9. Try counting</p><p>A longstanding method of inducing sleep is counting down slowly from 100. There are several ideas about why this may work, including boredom and distracting the individual from anxious thoughts.</p><p></p><p>10. Change your eating habits</p><p>What a person eats, particularly in the evening, can have an impact on their sleep. For example, eating a large meal within 1 hour of going to bed may impair a person’s ability to sleep.</p><p></p>Wag mag puyat sa maling taon<br />

Unable to free himself, he filled the forest with his angry roaring. The Mouse knew the voice and quickly found the Lion struggling in the net.
