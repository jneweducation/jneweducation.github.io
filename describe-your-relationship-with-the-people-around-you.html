                                            A Visit to the Farm
One summer vacation, Anna and Daniel visited their Uncle Ben’s mango farm in
the province. They enjoyed running around the trees full of fruits. In the farm, they were
delighted to watch the butterflies flying from one flower to another. The chirpings of the
little birds nesting on the tree sounds like music to them. The kids were amazed by the
agility of the chicken to catch worm. They have observed the different plants aside from
the tall mango trees, all finding their ways to have a share of sunlight. There were
farmers carefully harvesting some of the fruits. Amidst the tiring tasks they do in a hot
weather, the farmers were obviously happy and proud of the products of their hard
work. Ana and Daniel asked their Uncle Ben why he and the farmers enjoy their work
in the farm. Their Uncle Ben cheerfully answered, “We are always thankful that we have
farm to cultivate. We can provide food for our families and other people. No matter how
difficult and challenging it is, we are ready to help each other.”
Answer the following questions:
1. What are the organisms Anna and Daniel saw in the farm?
2. Were there interactions between the organisms and their environment?
3. What ecological relationships did Anna and Daniel observe in the farm? Cite the
scenario and the relationship.

4. Choose one ecological relationship from your answers in number 3 and describe

5. Why do Uncle Ben and the farmers enjoy their work?

                            13. A Visit to the Farm
One summer vacation, Anna and Daniel visited their Uncle Ben’s mango farm in
the province. They enjoyed running around the trees full of fruits. In the farm, they were
delighted to watch the butterflies flying from one flower to another. The chirpings of the
little birds nesting on the tree sounds like music to them. The kids were amazed by the
agility of the chicken to catch worm. They have observed the different plants aside from
the tall mango trees, all finding their ways to have a share of sunlight. There were
farmers carefully harvesting some of the fruits. Amidst the tiring tasks they do in a hot
weather, the farmers were obviously happy and proud of the products of their hard
work. Ana and Daniel asked their Uncle Ben why he and the farmers enjoy their work
in the farm. Their Uncle Ben cheerfully answered, “We are always thankful that we have
farm to cultivate. We can provide food for our families and other people. No matter how
difficult and challenging it is, we are ready to help each other.”
Answer the following questions:
1. What are the organisms Anna and Daniel saw in the farm?
2. Were there interactions between the organisms and their environment?
3. What ecological relationships did Anna and Daniel observe in the farm? Cite the
scenario and the relationship.
