Making decisions is making choices or not choosing at all. Deciding on your own may be very difficult at your age. Children like you need guidance from parents, guardians, or older siblings in making decisions. People have experienced making good and bad decisions and it is helpful to leam from it and move on. There are factors that influence the decision-making process of adolescence, like peer, environment, family, knowledge and skills to decide, beliefs, culture, and many more. In some studies, the psychological and social factors most of the time have great effect on the decisions of adolescents like you.​</a>

Here is the perfect system for cleaning your room. First, move all of the items that comhave a proper place to the center of the room. Get rid of at least five things that you have not used witthe last year. Take out all of the trash, and place all of the dirty dishes in the kitchen sind Neu find alocation for each of the items you had placed in the center of the room. For any remaining items, see youcan squeeze them in under your bed or stuff them into the back of your doset See, that was easy!2. Oceans and lakes have much in common, but they are also quite different. Both are bodiesof water, but oceans are very large bodies of salt water, while lakes are much smaller bodies of freshwater. Lakes are usually surrounded by land, while oceans are what surround continents. Both have plantsand animals living in them. The ocean is home to the largest animals on the planet, whereas lakes supportmuch smaller forms of life. When it is time for a vacation, both will make a great place to visit and enjoy3. I haven't been to Bali, Indonesia, but I have read about it. I have been to Boracay Island,that's why I know these two tourist destinations are similar in many ways. Both are small islands that havefive beachers, hillside terraces and cool green hills. Bali and Boracay boast of international cuisinesbecausepeople from all over the world visit them. However, Bali's beaches are golden while those of Boracay arewhite and the sand is fine as powder. A village in bali is famous for its golden and silver work. There is noneof this in Boracay. There is a cultural center in Bali called Ubud. On the other hand, there are only shopswhere you can buy goods that are very Filipino in Boracay.4. I do well in school, and people think I am smart because of it. But it's not true. In fact, threeyears ago I struggled in school. However, two years ago I decided to get serious about school and made afew changes. First, I decided I would become interested in whatever was being taught, regardless of whatother people thought. I also decided I would work hard every day and never give up on any assignment. 1decided to never, never fall behind. Finally, I decided to make school a priority over friends and fun. Afterimplementing these changes, I became an active participant in classroom discussions. Then my test scoresbegan to rise. I still remember the first time that someone made fun of me because "I was smart." Howexciting! It seems to me that being smart is simply a matter of working hard and being interested. After all,learning a new video game is hard work even when you are interested. Unfortunately, learning a new videogame doesn't help you get into college or get a good job.5. More and more children in the neighbourhood were becoming sick of respiratory diseases, so thebarangay officials planned out some action.

Now that you're older, you decide who your friends are and what groups you spend time with. Your friends your peers are people your age or close to it who have experiences and interests similar to yours. You and your friends make dozens of decisions every day, and you influence each other's choices and behaviors. This is often positive    - it's human nature to listen to and learn from other people in your age group. As you become more independent, your peers naturally play a greater role in your life. As school and other activities take you away from home, you may spend more time with peers than you do with your parents and siblings. You'll probably develop close friendships with some of your peers, and you may feel so connected to them that they are like an extended family. Besides close friends, your peers include other kids you know who are in the same age         — like people in your grade, church, sports team, or community. These peers also influence you by the way they dress and act, things they're involved in, and the attitudes they show. It's natural for people to identify with and compare themselves to their peers as they consider how they wish to be (or think they should be), or what they want to achieve. People are influenced by peers because they want to fit in, be like peers they admire, do what others are doing, or have what others have. -________________________________Reflect on the following pressing questions about violence in the media and write your answers on the space provided. 1.based on the text, who are the people which are considered as your peers?

Here is the perfect system for cleaning your room. First, move all of the items that comhave a proper place to the center of the room.

For any remaining items, see youcan squeeze them in under your bed or stuff them into the back of your doset See, that was easy!2. Oceans and lakes have much in common, but they are also quite different. Both are bodiesof water, but oceans are very large bodies of salt water, while lakes are much smaller bodies of freshwater. Lakes are usually surrounded by land, while oceans are what surround continents. Both have plantsand animals living in them. The ocean is home to the largest animals on the planet, whereas lakes supportmuch smaller forms of life. When it is time for a vacation, both will make a great place to visit and enjoy3. I haven't been to Bali, Indonesia, but I have read about it. I have been to Boracay Island,that's why I know these two tourist destinations are similar in many ways. Both are small islands that havefive beachers, hillside terraces and cool green hills. Bali and Boracay boast of international cuisinesbecausepeople from all over the world visit them. However, Bali's beaches are golden while those of Boracay arewhite and the sand is fine as powder. A village in bali is famous for its golden and silver work. There is noneof this in Boracay. There is a cultural center in Bali called Ubud. On the other hand, there are only shopswhere you can buy goods that are very Filipino in Boracay.4. I do well in school, and people think I am smart because of it. But it's not true. In fact, threeyears ago I struggled in school. However, two years ago I decided to get serious about school and made afew changes. First, I decided I would become interested in whatever was being taught, regardless of whatother people thought. I also decided I would work hard every day and never give up on any assignment. 1decided to never, never fall behind. Finally, I decided to make school a priority over friends and fun. Afterimplementing these changes, I became an active participant in classroom discussions. Then my test scoresbegan to rise. I still remember the first time that someone made fun of me because "I was smart." Howexciting! It seems to me that being smart is simply a matter of working hard and being interested. After all,learning a new video game is hard work even when you are interested. Unfortunately, learning a new videogame doesn't help you get into college or get a good job.5.

Tulong po thank You 3 day until dead line po tulong po help po Nonsense = reportCarefully read an excerpt of the article, Peer Pressure published by Kids Health Organization_______________________________ When you were a little kid, your parents usually chose your friends, putting you in play groups or arranging play dates with certain children they knew and liked. Now that you're older, you decide who your friends are and what groups you spend time with. Your friends your peers are people your age or close to it who have experiences and interests similar to yours. You and your friends make dozens of decisions every day, and you influence each other's choices and behaviors. This is often positive    - it's human nature to listen to and learn from other people in your age group. As you become more independent, your peers naturally play a greater role in your life. As school and other activities take you away from home, you may spend more time with peers than you do with your parents and siblings. You'll probably develop close friendships with some of your peers, and you may feel so connected to them that they are like an extended family. Besides close friends, your peers include other kids you know who are in the same age         — like people in your grade, church, sports team, or community. These peers also influence you by the way they dress and act, things they're involved in, and the attitudes they show. It's natural for people to identify with and compare themselves to their peers as they consider how they wish to be (or think they should be), or what they want to achieve. People are influenced by peers because they want to fit in, be like peers they admire, do what others are doing, or have what others have. -________________________________Reflect on the following pressing questions about violence in the media and write your answers on the space provided. 1.based on the text, who are the people which are considered as your peers?
