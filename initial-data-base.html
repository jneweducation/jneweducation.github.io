                                            von Koch Snowflake Your task is to create a piece of artwork based on at least one von Koch Snowflake. The artwork can include multiple von Koch Snowflakes, but at least one of these must meet the following requirement: the perimeter of the initial triangle must be 27 feet. You will first create a scaled version of the artwork using a triangle with a perimeter of 9 inches to represent the required triangle (perimeter of 27 feet). Be sure to base your data in the table on the triangle with a perimeter of 27 feet. Steps to creating a von Koch Snowflake Draw an equilateral triangle. Divide the sides of the triangle into thirds. Remove the middle third of each side. Add two additional line segments to each missing gap to form a smaller equilateral triangle. The first iteration of the snowflake should look like the Star of David. Continue this process until you cannot draw your triangles any smaller. NOTE: Be sure to complete the table based on an initial triangle with a perimeter of 27 feet. 2 3 5 n 4 6 Number of line segments (s) Length of each segment (1) Perimeter of snowflake (p) 1 3 3 9​</a>

                                            to Answer with TRUE or FALSE. la line graph illustrates how related data changes over a specific period of time. One might display a value, while the other axis shows the timeline. 2. a bar graph offers a simple way to compare numeric values of any kind. It can be either horizontal or vertical. The one axis represents the categories while the other axis represents the value of each category. 3. a pie chart uses pictures or symbols to display data instead of bars. Each picture represents a certain number of items. 4. a pictograph presents the different parts of a whole. It looks like a circle divided into many pieces, much like a pie cut into slices. The pieces are different sizes based on how much of the whole they represent. 5. a waterfall chart demonstrates both the positive and negative impact of different factors on an initial value.

                                            A projectile motion experiment has been carried out by a physics lab group. The goal was to analyse the maximum range of a projectile for different initial angles of launch in order to determine an experimental value for the acceleration due to gravity, g. For every launch the initial and final heights of the projectile above their lab table was the same and they used the same initial launch speed which was determined to be consistent at vo = 450 m/s. For each initial angle of launch, the students measured five values of the maximum range and their experimental data is shown in Tuote2.

                                            1. Use the graphing paper provided in the next page. I suggest you print the graph or make another one using a 
clean bond paper. 
2. Divide the Y axis into five parts and number the X axis from 1 to 28. Below the X axis, indicate the stages of the 
menstrual cycle based on the day. Data will not be plotted in the graph, but rather trends will be established. For 
example, day1 is the start of menstruation.
3. Use a red marker to indicate estrogen levels. Estrogen level increases gradually from day 1 to day 12 but will be 
about four times the initial amount on day 13. After ovulation, estrogen level decreases to twice its initial 
amount. Just before menstruation, it decreases back to its original level.
4. Use a green marker to indicate FSH levels. FSH begins at half the amount of estrogen levels. It then steadily 
increases from day 1 until the middle of the cycle. The peak is observed about halfway your X axis. It will steadily 
decrease back to its initial level at the beginning of menstruation.
5. Use a yellow marker to indicate LH levels. LH levels start with the same amount as FSH but will increase slightly 
from day 1 to day 11. At day 13 it will have a rapid increase to about four times its original amount. After two 
days, it returns abruptly to its original level and remains the same until the end of the cycle.
6. Lastly, use a blue marker to indicate progesterone levels. Progesterone starts with the same amount as FSH and 
LH and remains consistent until day 14. After which, progesterone will slowly increase in the next four days and 
will be eight times its original level on day 18. This will slowly decrease to its original level towards the end of the cycle.</a>

                            8. von Koch Snowflake Your task is to create a piece of artwork based on at least one von Koch Snowflake. The artwork can include multiple von Koch Snowflakes, but at least one of these must meet the following requirement: the perimeter of the initial triangle must be 27 feet. You will first create a scaled version of the artwork using a triangle with a perimeter of 9 inches to represent the required triangle (perimeter of 27 feet). Be sure to base your data in the table on the triangle with a perimeter of 27 feet. Steps to creating a von Koch Snowflake Draw an equilateral triangle. Divide the sides of the triangle into thirds. Remove the middle third of each side. Add two additional line segments to each missing gap to form a smaller equilateral triangle. The first iteration of the snowflake should look like the Star of David. Continue this process until you cannot draw your triangles any smaller.

                            20. A projectile motion experiment has been carried out by a physics lab group. The goal was to analyse the maximum range of a projectile for different initial angles of launch in order to determine an experimental value for the acceleration due to gravity, g. For every launch the initial and final heights of the projectile above their lab table was the same and they used the same initial launch speed which was determined to be consistent at vo = 450 m/s. For each initial angle of launch, the students measured five values of the maximum range and their experimental data is shown in Tuote2.

                            29. 1. Use the graphing paper provided in the next page. I suggest you print the graph or make another one using a 
clean bond paper. 
2. Divide the Y axis into five parts and number the X axis from 1 to 28. Below the X axis, indicate the stages of the 
menstrual cycle based on the day. Data will not be plotted in the graph, but rather trends will be established. For 
example, day1 is the start of menstruation.
3. Use a red marker to indicate estrogen levels. Estrogen level increases gradually from day 1 to day 12 but will be 
about four times the initial amount on day 13. After ovulation, estrogen level decreases to twice its initial 
amount. Just before menstruation, it decreases back to its original level.
4. Use a green marker to indicate FSH levels. FSH begins at half the amount of estrogen levels. It then steadily 
increases from day 1 until the middle of the cycle. The peak is observed about halfway your X axis. It will steadily 
decrease back to its initial level at the beginning of menstruation.
5. Use a yellow marker to indicate LH levels. LH levels start with the same amount as FSH but will increase slightly 
from day 1 to day 11. At day 13 it will have a rapid increase to about four times its original amount. After two 
days, it returns abruptly to its original level and remains the same until the end of the cycle.
6. Lastly, use a blue marker to indicate progesterone levels. Progesterone starts with the same amount as FSH and 
LH and remains consistent until day 14. After which, progesterone will slowly increase in the next four days and 
will be eight times its original level on day 18. This will slowly decrease to its original level towards the end of the cycle.</h2><br />

A 195 gram projectile with an initial velocity of 552 m/s took 105 μs to go through a plate. Instrument shows that the projectile lost 37% of its initial momentum. 
Questions:
Final velocity of the projectile. = Answer for part 1
 m/s (2 decimal places) (1 point)
Magnitude of force that slowed the projectile. = Answer for part 2
 N (2 decimal places) (2 points)
Impulse based on the given data. = Answer for part 3
 N•s (2 decimal places) (2 points)
Notes:
Magnitude is expressed in absolute value therefore always express it in positive.
