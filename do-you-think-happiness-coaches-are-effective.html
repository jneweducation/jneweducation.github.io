                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Passionate coaches should direct their passion onto the process of coaching, of improving players and developing a team.

                            14. what do you think would be your best asset for a successful coaching career in the future​</h2><br />
                        1. It's the Greatest Return on Investment, Anywhere<br /><br />The return on investing and improving yourself is astronomically higher than any financial investment you could make. From increased lifetime earning power and unimagined opportunities, to protecting yourself from unemployment and the satisfaction that comes from personal growth and success, the returns are enormous.<br /><br />2. You're the Boss of You<br /><br />If you're the president and CEO of You Inc., then it's your job to ensure you don't go out of business. It's your job to nurture growth and prosperity. You do this by planning carefully, performing consistently, operating true to your mission and investing in You Inc.<br /><br />3. You Become More Valuable<br /><br />Draw up two balance sheets for yourself. On the first, list your financial assets and liabilities. On the second, list your skills, ideas, knowledge, marketability, personal networks, passion and ability to make things happen. Increase your personal net worth by investing in your second list -- that's how you'll increase the assets on your first list.<br /><br />4. You Can Become Great<br /><br />You are capable of greatness. Most of us settle for just getting by, using a fraction of our capabilities. This is tragic. Realize your greatness by identifying your talents and investing in your potential.<br /><br />5. You Can Achieve Your Goals<br /><br />Your career and life goals are far too important to be just wishes. A mismanaged career can derail your life goals. Investing in yourself dramatically increases the probability of achieving your goals and is a real demonstration of your commitment to achieving them.<br /><br />6. You Create Your Own Future<br /><br />Your career is yours to mold. Investing in yourself gives you the clarity, power and tools to create your own future and take the path less traveled. Sometimes, investing means taking a risk, but that's the price of entry for success and happiness.<br /><br />7. Because the World Is a Complex Place<br /><br />You cannot know everything you need to know or do everything you need to do alone. You can't be your best without help. Find and invest in those who can teach you, show you the way and help you achieve your goals.<br /><br />8. Life Is Too Short for Mediocrity<br /><br />You don't have the luxury of being mediocre -- period. Whether you opt for self-improvement or outsourcing your weak areas to someone who can do them better, determine where you are mediocre and get help.<br /><br />9. It's a Cliche, But on Your Deathbed...<br /><br />The reason we hear this often is that it is so true. The passage of time will provide a perspective we don't have now. One day, you'll look back at your problems and successes and see them as bumps in the road. Your focus will be on the big picture: the life you led, opportunities pursued or abandoned, how happy you were, and the legacy you left behind. Investing in yourself will give you the courage and determination to be happy and do your own thing.<br /><br />10. Who Else Can You Count On?<br /><br />Let's face it: You're alone on this. No one has as much to gain or lose as you do. No one else is going to make those consistent investments in your development to maximize your career and life.<br />

                        I prefer to take my own assessment for the choice of career that I will pursue for I am only one who knows what I can do and what career that I will enjoy after I take an assessment and realize what I will take. More than that, hiring a coach or should we say a professional might help and influence my decisions but instead of using the money for choosing a career, why I spend it on the actual career that I will choose and by technology there are a lot of free informations and influencing videos or articles to see, nonetheless after the sessions with the coach you will only be the one who can tell what you want so I will only take a career self assessment.<br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>exercise before the game biggin and eat healthy food</p><p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>1.Sportsmanship - Remember basic courtesy and good manners Use our  practices and games to reinforce these basic principles. Make sure your players can give a firm handshake with eye contact to officials and opposing coaches, as well as a high five to opposing players.</p><p></p><p>2.Teamwork - To teach your players that "we over me" is what most often leads to "us over them," in team sports competition. Encourage your players to be selfless and supportive teammates in both losing and winning efforts.</p><p></p><p>3.Positive Attitude - Life is not fair and basketball is worse. Help your players get over it and still do what they need to do to succeed. Playing sports is one the best ways to practice overcoming adversity and preparing to handle tough times in life. Humor helps!</p><p></p><p>4.Respect - Pay it forward and get it back. How a coach interacts with other adults--coaches, parents and officials--will naturally influence the behavior of your players.
