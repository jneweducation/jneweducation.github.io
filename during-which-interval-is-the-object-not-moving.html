                                            I have learned that (1) __________ can be describe as a change in position. We need to know first the (2) ___________ , it is something that is stationary and fixed. You can determine whether an object moves by comparing its position to that of a fixed point. The (3) _________ is a scalar quantity that refers to “how much ground an object has covered" during its motion. The total length covered by moving body or the entire path that the object travelled. While (4) _________ is a vector quantity that refers to "how far out of place an object is". It is the object's overall change in position. It refers to the shortest distance between the object’s two positions, like the distance between its point of origin and its point of destination, no matter what path it took to get to that destination.The distance covered in a unit of time also known as (5) __________ can be defined as “how fast something moves” and (6) _________ can be defined as “speed having direction”. What we read from the speedometer is (7) _________ and the (8) __________ is calculated with displacement over time interval.Another description of motion is (9) ___________ which define as “change in velocity” and speeding up objects, while the slowing down objects is term as (10)________deceleration, motion, speed, average speed, displacement

                                            TRUE OR FALSE.      1.Motion is the change of position during an interval if time.  2.A scalar quantity has a magnitude and a vector quantity does not.      3. The sign of the speed of an object tells us in which direction it is travelling.      4. Velocity tells you how fast an object travels at a certain time, while distance tells you how far an object has moved.    5. An object which is slowing down has an acceleration.

(10) ____________.</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>#BrainlyFast</strong></p><p></p><p>I have learned that <strong>(1) Motion</strong> can be describe as a change in position. We
</p><p>need to know first the <strong>(2) reference point</strong> , it is something that is stationary and  fixed. You can determine whether an object moves by comparing its position to  that of a fixed point.  The <strong>(3) distance</strong> is a scalar quantity that refers to “how much ground an object  has covered" during its motion. The total length covered by moving body or the  entire path that the object travelled. While <strong>(4) displacement</strong> is a vector quantity  that refers to "how far out of place an object is". It is the object's overall change  in position. It refers to the shortest distance between the object’s two positions,  like the distance between its point of origin and its point of destination, no  matter what path it took to get to that destination.  The distance covered in a unit of time also known as <strong>(5) speed</strong> can be
</p><p>defined as “how fast something moves” and <strong>(6) velocity</strong> can be defined as
</p><p>“speed having direction”. What we read from the speedometer is <strong>(7) speed</strong>
</p><p>and the <strong>(8) velocity</strong> is calculated with displacement over time interval.
</p><p>Another description of motion is <strong>(9) acceleration </strong>which define as “change in  velocity” and speeding up objects, while the slowing down objects is term as
<strong> (10) decelerating</strong>.

In other words, the object's speed remains the same and is not accelerating or decelerating. This means that the distance traveled and the time taken to travel that distance are directly proportional to each other, and that the object travels the same distance in equal time intervals.</p><p></p><p><strong>Constant speed</strong> is an example of uniform motion, which is motion that occurs at a steady pace and does not change velocity. This is in contrast to non-uniform motion, which occurs when an object changes its velocity, such as when it speeds up or slows down.</p><p></p><p><strong>Constant speed </strong>can be measured in different units such as meters per second (m/s), kilometers per hour (km/h) or miles per hour (mph). An <strong>example</strong> of an object that is moving at a constant speed is a car traveling down a highway. The car's speedometer shows that it is traveling at a specific speed, and as long as the car is not accelerating or decelerating, it is moving at a constant speed.</p><p></p><p>In physics, <strong>Constant speed </strong>is a key concept in kinematics, which is the study of motion. It is also related to other concepts such as distance, displacement, velocity, and acceleration, and is used to calculate these quantities.</p><p></p><p>For more information about constant speed, click the link below.</p><p>https://brainly.ph/question/22457392</p><p></p><p>#SPJ6</p><br />
