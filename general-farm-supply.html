                                            nswer the following questions.NATURE'S GIFT: WATERWater is essential to human life. Man uses water for drinking andfor cleaning himself, his food, and the things he uses. With water, manis able to keep his home safe and clean.Water is important to plants. In fact, it is their lifeblood. It is presentin all of their parts, from the roots to the tips of the leaves. Watercombines with carbon dioxide from the air to make food for plants.To grow, plant tissue requires the right amount of moisture at the righttime. Without enough water, plants wither die. This usually happensduring hot weather. Water also service as the food Canle to thevarious part of the plant. In their green state, common plant cellscontain approximately 70 to 80 percent water, Soil, on the otherhand, may have only 20 percent water.Farmers use water for their farms. As a general rule, the amountof moisture in the soil affects the yield of most crops. Every farmerknows that one of the effects of either in adequate or excessivewater in poor harvest. Poor yield also means less profit. Seeding andcrops will die without adequate water supply, Farmer can have justenough water for his farm, neither too much nor too little, he can besure to have the highest possible yield.Another important use of water is the production of electric powerneeded by factories and homes. To generate electricity, man useswater to turn a turbine. A turbine is a kind of water wheel upon whichwater falls. Falling water exerts a force on the movable blades of theturbine, causing them to turn. Water turbines are used to run electricpower plant.Guide Questions:1. What is the best gift that nature gives to man?2. What are the importance of water to plants?3. How do water help the farmer?4. Why do we need to protect the gift of nature​</a>

[10](Consequently/Meanwhile), a known dairy company, investedlarge amount of money to our small-scale farm. We accepted its offer. || (Infact/Wherefore), we have already started the expansion of our farm. From 20remaining cows and carabaos, we now have at least hundreds of them. Ourhumble farm can now provide a large amount of milk products to our partner-company. [12] (For instance/Henceforth), we can at least supply them 500liters of milk per day (13) (importantly/notwithstanding) the El Niñophenomenon that we are currently experiencing.[141(As a result/Similar) of this success, our family is planning to furtherexpand our business venture, 1151 (for example/to demonstrate), production ofother farm products from hogs and chicken. [16) (Coupled with/Whereas) ourdedication and enthusiasm, our partner-company has pledged to continuouslysupport us in this endeavor. 1171 (Comparatively/In fact), we are now workingon our feasibility study about this concept. pel(Consequently/Furthermore),other government policies and bank loans are considered for this project,1191 (In conclusion/Otherwise), starting a business is not really an easytask, 120 (even more/indeed) a difficult one. 21 (Instead/While) others may notbelieve in your capacity, it is your duty to trust yourself and the process.

On Small-Scale Farming
by Jhonathan S. Cadavido
Carabaos and cows are important farm animals. [1] (Together with/Similar) other animals, they both help farmers in producing milk and other farm and dairy products. Meat, [2] (namely/for example), is one of the most important products that both of them can provide. [3] (Besides/Moreover), milk is also an essential item that carabaos and cows produce. [4] (In fact/Indeed), kesong puti is good for breakfast as spread or stuffing for varieties of bread [5] (that is/such as) pandesal and loaf bread. [6] (Therefore/Indeed), cows and carabaos can produce food items that we need in our daily lives.
Last year, we had to sell dozens of carabaos and cows for my parents to financially support me with my studies. [7] (As a result/Accordingly), my family recorded and generated small return of investment for that year. [8] (Instead/Although) we suffered a great loss, we still managed to survive with the help of my uncle.
Uncle Romeo has lent us his resources. [9] (On the other hand/Together with) this, he looked for possible investors who would finance our small farm business. [10] (Consequently/Meanwhile), a known dairy company, invested large amount of money to our small-scale farm. We accepted its offer. [11] (In fact/Wherefore), we have already started the expansion of our farm. From 20 remaining cows and carabaos, we now have at least hundreds of them. Our humble farm can now provide a large amount of milk products to our partner-company.

Man uses water for drinking andfor cleaning himself, his food, and the things he uses. With water, manis able to keep his home safe and clean.Water is important to plants. In fact, it is their lifeblood. It is presentin all of their parts, from the roots to the tips of the leaves. Watercombines with carbon dioxide from the air to make food for plants.To grow, plant tissue requires the right amount of moisture at the righttime. Without enough water, plants wither die. This usually happensduring hot weather. Water also service as the food Canle to thevarious part of the plant. In their green state, common plant cellscontain approximately 70 to 80 percent water, Soil, on the otherhand, may have only 20 percent water.Farmers use water for their farms. As a general rule, the amountof moisture in the soil affects the yield of most crops. Every farmerknows that one of the effects of either in adequate or excessivewater in poor harvest. Poor yield also means less profit. Seeding andcrops will die without adequate water supply, Farmer can have justenough water for his farm, neither too much nor too little, he can besure to have the highest possible yield.Another important use of water is the production of electric powerneeded by factories and homes. To generate electricity, man useswater to turn a turbine. A turbine is a kind of water wheel upon whichwater falls. Falling water exerts a force on the movable blades of theturbine, causing them to turn. Water turbines are used to run electricpower plant.Guide Questions:1. What is the best gift that nature gives to man?2. What are the importance of water to plants?3. How do water help the farmer?4. Why do we need to protect the gift of nature​</h2><br />

(Together with/Similar) other animals, they both help farmers in producing milk and other farm and dairy products. Meat, 12) (namely/ for example), is one of the most important products that both of them can provide. [3] (Besides/Moreover), milk is also an essential item that carabaos and cows produce. [4] (In fact/Indeed), kesong puti is good for breakfast as spread or stuffing for varieties of bread 15) (that is/such as) pandesal and loaf bread. 16) (Therefore/Indeed), cows and carabaos can produce food items that we need in our daily lives. Last year, we had to sell dozens of carabaos and cows for my parents to financially support me with my studies. 171 (As a result/Accordingly), my family recorded and generated small return of investment for that year. 18 (Instead/ Although) we suffered a great loss, we still managed to survive with the help of my uncle. Uncle Romeo has lent us his resources. [9] (On the other hand/Together with) this, he looked for possible investors who would finance our small farm business. [10 (Consequently/Meanwhile), a known dairy company, invested large amount of money to our small-scale farm. We accepted its offer. [1] (In fact/Wherefore), we have already started the expansion of our farm. From 20 remaining cows and carabaos, we now have at least hundreds of them. Our humble farm can now provide a large amount of milk products to our partner- company. [12] (For instance/Henceforth), we can at least supply them 500 liters of milk per day 113) (importantly/notwithstanding) the El Niño phenomenon that we are currently experiencing. [14) (As a result/Similar) of this success, our family is planning to further expand our business venture, [15) (for example/to demonstrate), production of other farm products from hogs and chicken. [16] (Coupled with/Whereas) our dedication and enthusiasm, our partner-company has pledged to continuously support us in this endeavor, 117) (Comparatively/In fact), we are now working on our feasibility study about this concept. 18 (Consequently/Furthermore), other government policies and bank loans are considered for this project. (In conclusion/Otherwise), starting a business is not really an easy task, (20 (even more/indeed) a difficult one. 2 (Instead/While) others may not believe in your capacity, it is your duty to trust yourself and the process.

On Small-Scale Farming
by Jhonathan S. Cadavido
Carabaos and cows are important farm animals. [1] (Together with/Similar) other animals, they both help farmers in producing milk and other farm and dairy products. Meat, [2] (namely/for example), is one of the most important products that both of them can provide. [3] (Besides/Moreover), milk is also an essential item that carabaos and cows produce. [4] (In fact/Indeed), kesong puti is good for breakfast as spread or stuffing for varieties of bread [5] (that is/such as) pandesal and loaf bread. [6] (Therefore/Indeed), cows and carabaos can produce food items that we need in our daily lives.
Last year, we had to sell dozens of carabaos and cows for my parents to financially support me with my studies. [7] (As a result/Accordingly), my family recorded and generated small return of investment for that year. [8] (Instead/Although) we suffered a great loss, we still managed to survive with the help of my uncle.
Uncle Romeo has lent us his resources. [9] (On the other hand/Together with) this, he looked for possible investors who would finance our small farm business. [10] (Consequently/Meanwhile), a known dairy company, invested large amount of money to our small-scale farm. We accepted its offer. [11] (In fact/Wherefore), we have already started the expansion of our farm. From 20 remaining cows and carabaos, we now have at least hundreds of them. Our humble farm can now provide a large amount of milk products to our partner-company. [12] (For instance/Henceforth), we can at least supply them 500 liters of milk per day [13] (importantly/notwithstanding) the El Niño phenomenon that we are currently experiencing.
[14] (As a result/Similar) of this success, our family is planning to further expand our business venture, [15] (for example/to demonstrate), production of other farm products from hogs and chicken. [16] (Coupled with/Whereas) our dedication and enthusiasm, our partner-company has pledged to continuously support us in this endeavor. [17] (Comparatively/In fact), we are now working on our feasibility study about this concept. [18] (Consequently/Furthermore), other government policies and bank loans are considered for this project.
[19] (In conclusion/Otherwise), starting a business is not really an easy task, [20] (even more/indeed) a difficult one. [21] (Instead/While) others may not believe in your capacity, it is your duty to trust yourself and the process. With faith and confidence, you will surely achieve your dreams. From carabaos and cows, our small farm will soon be one of the famous haciendas in town producing and delivering quality products and goods.</h2><br />
