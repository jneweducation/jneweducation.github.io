                            16. Read the excerpt from "What to the Slave is the Fourth of July?”  The feeling of the nation must be quickened; the conscience of the nation must be roused; the propriety of the nation must be startled; the hypocrisy of the nation must be exposed; and its crimes against God and man must be proclaimed and denounced.  How does the repetition of the word “must” affect the tone of the piece? The repetition shows that the speaker is concerned about something. The repetition draws attention to the speaker’s anger. The repetition suggests that the speaker is intimidating and demanding. The repetition intensifies the speaker’s sense of urgency.</h2><br />
                        <strong>Fourth of July</strong><p>The use of the word “must” intensifies the speaker’s urgency to attain those things stated in the excerpt.
</p><p></p><p>The <strong>fourth of July</strong> represents the independence of America from the grasps of Britain. And just like any other form of victory, it is something that is worth teaching in history books and schools in order for the youth to remember the day where they were able to be free from a bigger country. It is a valuable day which should be retained in the minds of the people.  Their appreciation and happiness of this day by:
</p>Doing celebrations  Enabling people to express their joy in streets
Using symbolic things such as the colors of their flag
<p>Pertaining back to the title of the excerpt, what does it even mean for the slaves? And what value is there in that certain day in July? In a common understanding of the title alone, we may assume that by the <strong>fourth day of July</strong> which means being free and independent will also mean that those slaves are now free and are able to live their life fully.
</p><p>Alas, the true meaning of this excerpt is the total opposite of this. It is known to history about the White and Black race disputes where the black people are used as slaves to manual labor for the white people. They were stripped from every right and was given mistreatment all their living with their co-American people. Some were forced to be slaves to their own land and were treated as nothing more than a low human being.
</p><p>The speech or the excerpt was from Frederick Douglass an orator who had given abolition towards slavery of his fellow citizens. He insisted in the speech that his presence to give a piece was unnecessary. The <strong>fourth of July</strong> may be a glorious event for the white people but it doesn’t mean anything for the slaves since their freedom was something they didn’t even have even at first.  </p><p>The speaker shows a sense of urgency in the excerpt because:
</p>He wants to honor the founding fathers but also expose the hypocrisy behind it
He says demands but not in an intimidating tone but in a matter of being dignified
 He speaks for his people’s struggles and doesn’t want to rejoice over something that didn’t include them as one
