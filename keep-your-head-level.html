3. What is happiness? Happiness to me is not having everything but it is the state of being contented and satisfied with what one has. A girl who finds her old little doll a playmate and sister who completes her day is a happy child. But an old man who has a lot of wealth and has achieved much successes can remain unhappy if he feels he still lacks many things. He is such a pity.

8. Happiness is the state of being contented and satisfied with what you have. Have you ever asked yourself what simple joys you regularly have in your life? Here are some of the inexpensive pleasures that I indulge in to keep me sane in this beautiful but crazy world. I pray in quiet for ten minutes each morning. I pray for my family and friends that they may be able to surpass anything that may come their way each day. I make sure I have my “ME” time and read books as a form of relaxation. For me, happiness is not only for a millionaire. It is the ordinary things that we do that make our lives worth living. There are simple joys that I have which make my life like that of a millionaire.

Earthquakes are among the most destructive natural disasters. They occur mainly near the edges of tectonic plates, but they can happen just about anywhere. Earthquakes cannot be predicted, but your chances of survival are much better if you prepare in advance and know what to do when an earthquake strikes. you What do you do if you are in a vehicle? If an earthquake strikes, stop your vehicle as quickly and as safely as possible. You must then stay in the vehicle. Avoid stopping near, or under, buildings, trees, overpasses, and utility wires. They can fall onto your vehicle, which could cause injury. Stay seated, until the earthquake is over. You must keep calm - metal will protect you and your family. When you are in a garage, get out of the car immediately; Crouch down next to the car, cover your head and hold on to the car wheel. Unfortunately, the metal will not protect you from the concrete (from the roof) that could fall on it. If you are in a multi-level car park, survival mainly comes down to luck. The best way to maximize your chances of survival, is to do what you do in a garage - crouch next to the car. Do not try to rush back to your home because the earthquake may spring into life again. Most major quakes have aftershocks, which should not be underestimated. Once you are confident the quake has finished, proceed cautiously. (Avoid roads, bridges, or ramps that might have been damaged by the earthquake). If you become trapped or blocked, wait for city relief efforts. Before long emergency relief efforts should arrive to assist with your freedom.​</a>

MANILA, Philippines San Miguel bounced back and humbled top team TNT, 83-67, in the 2021 PBA Philippine Cup Wednesday at DHVSU Gym in Bacolor, Pampanga. The Beermen, who suffered a shock 110-104 loss to Terrafirma last week, snapped the Tropang Giga's perfect six-game start to the conference. San Miguel Beer went on a 20 - 7 start and never looked back as it held TNT to a shell of its former self, limiting the Tropang Giga to their lowest offensive output since November 2013 when they dropped a 77-63 decision to Petron. "This is a big game for us and I'm thankful for the players because the sense of urgency is there," said San Miguel head coach Leo Austria as his team improved to 4 - 2 record to get to the fourth spot in the ladder.2. There should be zoos because zoos save animals and help people learn a lot about them. Did you know that thirty species of animals were saved because of zoos? Zoos give great care that most animals don't receive in the wild. When they get sick or hurt, expert veterinarians look after them until they get totally healed. In many big zoos, animals are made to feel like they are in the wild. There are no longer cages, and the fences are hidden. Zookeepers hide the food from the animals so they can learn to hunt, and in some zoos, glass walls are tinted so the animals don't see the chaos created by people around them. I am really glad the zookeepers give their time to care for the animals, and I am thankful we have zoos.Read each of the sentences below and identify its type of journalistic writing.

MANILA-Both vaccinated and unvaccinated individuals may visit reopened parks in Manila following the region's shift to Alert Level 4. the tourism chief said Saturday, as restrictions remain in place to prevent the spread of COVID-194. With the ongoing pandemic and scarcity of available vaccines, senior citizens who are mostly grandparents and children below 18 years old have been cooped up at home for more than 18 months. Living with both age category groups in one house, especially during this unprecedented situation that we are in, is a blessing,but it also has its fair challenges. Peace and quiet are far and in between, which can be frustrating for those who work at home. But the upside to this is that grandparents can help take care of the kids as the parents go about their busy schedules. Families who aren't fortunate enough to share the same home have to make that extra effort to reach out to their loved ones, more so for those with elders who aren't tech savvy to order online for everyday essentials. Regular virtual calls to check on them have become a staple in routine. Whatever the setup is, we all share the same concern-the wellbeing of our grandparents/senior citizens should be part of our topmost priorities.5. Reading is fun! But should it be required?

But an old man who has a lot of wealth and has achieved much successes can remain unhappy if he feels he still lacks many things. He is such a pity.

8. Happiness is the state of being contented and satisfied with what you have. Have you ever asked yourself what simple joys you regularly have in your life? Here are some of the inexpensive pleasures that I indulge in to keep me sane in this beautiful but crazy world. I pray in quiet for ten minutes each morning. I pray for my family and friends that they may be able to surpass anything that may come their way each day. I make sure I have my “ME” time and read books as a form of relaxation. For me, happiness is not only for a millionaire. It is the ordinary things that we do that make our lives worth living. There are simple joys that I have which make my life like that of a millionaire.

The sun is a star, while the moon is a large mass of work rock and dirt. According to most theories, the sun formed from the solar nebula, a giant mass of cloud and dust that collapsed because of its gravity. When it did, the material that pulled into the center formed the sun when the Earth was formed in the early solar system, it didn't have moon.

Guide him/her in writing the important details in a graphic organizer then compose a paragraph about the passage How do you survive an earthquake? Earthquakes are among the most destructive natural disasters. They occur mainly near the edges of tectonic plates, but they can happen just about anywhere. Earthquakes cannot be predicted, but your chances of survival are much better if you prepare in advance and know what to do when an earthquake strikes. you What do you do if you are in a vehicle? If an earthquake strikes, stop your vehicle as quickly and as safely as possible. You must then stay in the vehicle. Avoid stopping near, or under, buildings, trees, overpasses, and utility wires. They can fall onto your vehicle, which could cause injury. Stay seated, until the earthquake is over. You must keep calm - metal will protect you and your family. When you are in a garage, get out of the car immediately; Crouch down next to the car, cover your head and hold on to the car wheel. Unfortunately, the metal will not protect you from the concrete (from the roof) that could fall on it. If you are in a multi-level car park, survival mainly comes down to luck. The best way to maximize your chances of survival, is to do what you do in a garage - crouch next to the car. Do not try to rush back to your home because the earthquake may spring into life again. Most major quakes have aftershocks, which should not be underestimated. Once you are confident the quake has finished, proceed cautiously. (Avoid roads, bridges, or ramps that might have been damaged by the earthquake). If you become trapped or blocked, wait for city relief efforts. Before long emergency relief efforts should arrive to assist with your freedom.​</h2><br />

There should be zoos because zoos save animals and help people learn a lot about them. Did you know that thirty species of animals were saved because of zoos? Zoos give great care that most animals don't receive in the wild. When they get sick or hurt, expert veterinarians look after them until they get totally healed. In many big zoos, animals are made to feel like they are in the wild. There are no longer cages, and the fences are hidden. Zookeepers hide the food from the animals so they can learn to hunt, and in some zoos, glass walls are tinted so the animals don't see the chaos created by people around them. I am really glad the zookeepers give their time to care for the animals, and I am thankful we have zoos.Read each of the sentences below and identify its type of journalistic writing.

MANILA-Both vaccinated and unvaccinated individuals may visit reopened parks in Manila following the region's shift to Alert Level 4. the tourism chief said Saturday, as restrictions remain in place to prevent the spread of COVID-194. With the ongoing pandemic and scarcity of available vaccines, senior citizens who are mostly grandparents and children below 18 years old have been cooped up at home for more than 18 months. Living with both age category groups in one house, especially during this unprecedented situation that we are in, is a blessing,but it also has its fair challenges. Peace and quiet are far and in between, which can be frustrating for those who work at home. But the upside to this is that grandparents can help take care of the kids as the parents go about their busy schedules. Families who aren't fortunate enough to share the same home have to make that extra effort to reach out to their loved ones, more so for those with elders who aren't tech savvy to order online for everyday essentials. Regular virtual calls to check on them have become a staple in routine. Whatever the setup is, we all share the same concern-the wellbeing of our grandparents/senior citizens should be part of our topmost priorities.5. Reading is fun! But should it be required?
