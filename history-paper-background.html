                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>attack on titan in history ohh</p><p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Study design depends greatly on the nature of the research question. In other words, knowing what kind of information the study should collect is a first step in determining how the study will be carried out (also known as the methodology).
</p><p>
</p><p>Let’s say we want to investigate the relationship between daily walking and cholesterol levels in the body. One of the first things we’d have to determine is the type of study that will tell us the most about that relationship. Do we want to compare cholesterol levels among different populations of walkers and non-walkers at the same point in time? Or, do we want to measure cholesterol levels in a single population of daily walkers over an extended period of time?
</p><p>
</p><p>The first approach is typical of a cross-sectional study. The second requires a longitudinal study. To make our choice, we need to know more about the benefits and purpose of each study type.
</p><p>
</p><p>Cross-sectional study
</p><p>Both the cross-sectional and the longitudinal studies are observational studies. This means that researchers record information about their subjects without manipulating the study environment. In our study, we would simply measure the cholesterol levels of daily walkers and non-walkers along with any other characteristics that might be of interest to us. We would not influence non-walkers to take up that activity, or advise daily walkers to modify their behaviour. In short, we’d try not to interfere.
</p><p>
</p><p>The defining feature of a cross-sectional study is that it can compare different population groups at a single point in time. Think of it in terms of taking a snapshot. Findings are drawn from whatever fits into the frame.
</p><p>
</p><p>To return to our example, we might choose to measure cholesterol levels in daily walkers across two age groups, over 40 and under 40, and compare these to cholesterol levels among non-walkers in the same age groups. We might even create subgroups for gender. However, we would not consider past or future cholesterol levels, for these would fall outside the frame. We would look only at cholesterol levels at one point in time.
</p><p>
</p><p>The benefit of a cross-sectional study design is that it allows researchers to compare many different variables at the same time. We could, for example, look at age, gender, income and educational level in relation to walking and cholesterol levels, with little or no additional cost.
</p><p>
</p><p>However, cross-sectional studies may not provide definite information about cause-and-effect relationships. This is because such studies offer a snapshot of a single moment in time; they do not consider what happens before or after the snapshot is taken. Therefore, we can’t know for sure if our daily walkers had low cholesterol levels before taking up their exercise regimes, or if the behaviour of daily walking helped to reduce cholesterol levels that previously were high.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p></p><br />

The sequence of the dance varies, but typically includes multiple movements such as three steps and a point, pointing, hide-and-seek with a fan, kneeling with a fan, and partner work that is performed back-to-back.</p><p></p><p>Tinikling - Tinikling commonly involves two people moving two bamboo poles back and forth along the ground, with the poles tapping against each other and the ground to emphasize a musical rhythm, while simultaneously one or more dancers are stepping over and between the poles (13).</p><p></p><p>Sayaw sa bangko - The dance is performed on top of a narrow bench. The dancers will requirements good balance as they go through a series of movements with some impressive acrobatics</p><p></p><p>Waltz - The Waltz is a smooth dance that travels around the line of dance. Characterized by its "rise and fall" action, the Waltz includes a step, slide, and step in 3/4 time. Dancers should move their shoulders smoothly, parallel with the floor instead of up and down, and they must strive to lengthen each step.Jan 27, 2019</p><p></p><p>Pandanggo sa ilaw - Pandanggo is a Philippine folk dance which has become popular in the rural areas of the Philippines. The dance evolved from Fandango, a Spanish folk dance, which arrived in the Philippines during the Hispanic period. The dance is accompanied by castanets.[1] This dance, together with the Jota, became popular among the illustrados or the upper class and later adapted among the local communities. In the early 18th century, any dance that is considered jovial and lively was called Pandanggo.</p><br />
