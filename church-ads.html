                                            Verse 46 In the beginning, the Mother Church at Jerusalem still participated in the Jewish worship in the temple. "They went to the temple area together every day and prayed." The first Christians lived with the traditional Jewish forms of piety, but a new form of worship was added - the celebration of the breaking of the bread which later became the Eucharist. Christian hymns developed later, the earliest of which were the "Magnificat" and the "Benedictus," while the "Lord's Prayer" was a typical petition prayer in the synagogue.explain briefly​</a>

                                            As we celebrate the 500 years of Christianity, the Philippine Church
declares 2021 as the Year of “Missio ad Gentes”, the Latin for “mission
to the nations”. In line with our previous topic on Jesus’s mission as
Anointed Son of God, it says that we share in the messianic mission of
Jesus because we are members of His church. As a student, in what way
you can share in the mission of Christ during this pandemic crisis?

                                            Verse 46 In the beginning, the Mother Church at Jerusalem still participated in the Jewish worship in the temple. "They went to the temple area together every day and prayed.” The first Christians lived with the traditional Jewish forms of piety, but a new form of worship was added - the celebration of the breaking of the bread which later became the Eucharist. Christian hymns developed later, the earliest of which were the "Magnificat” and the “Benedictus," while the "Lord's Prayer" was a typical petition prayer in the synagogue.explain briefly​</a>

                        Divinely sent to the nations of the world to be unto them "a universal sacrament of salvation,"(1) the Church, driven by the inner necessity of her own catholicity, and obeying the mandate of her Founder (cf. Mark 16:16), strives ever to proclaim the Gospel to all men. The Apostles themselves, on whom the Church was founded, following in the footsteps of Christ, "preached the word of truth and begot churches."(2) It is the duty of their successors to make this task endure "so that the word of God may run and be glorified (2 Thess. 3:1) and the kingdom of God be proclaimed and established throughout the world.In the present state of affairs, out of which there is arising a new situation for mankind, the Church, being the salt of the earth and the light of the world (cf. Matt. 5:13-14), is more urgently called upon to save and renew every creature, that all things may be restored in Christ and all men may constitute one family in Him and one people of God.Therefore, this sacred synod, while rendering thanks to God for the excellent results that have been achieved through the whole Church's great - hearted endeavor, desires to sketch the principles of missionary activity and to rally the forces of all the faithful in order that the people of God, marching along the narrow way of the Cross, may spread everywhere the reign of Christ, Lord and overseer: of the ages (cf. Ecc. 36:19), and may prepare the way for his coming.<br />

Polyphonic genres began to develop during the high medieval becoming prevalent by the later thirteenth and early fourteenth century. The Church was very much a part of the Medieval life. The church held worship services and took care of the sick, poor, elderly, and orphans. 1. What do you think is the center of life during the Medieval Period? Why? 2. What kind of music prevailed during the period?​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Migration period, also called Dark Ages or Early Middle Ages, the early medieval period of western European history—specifically, the time (476–800 CE) when there was no Roman (or Holy Roman) emperor in the West or, more generally, the period between about 500 and 1000, which was marked by frequent warfare and a virtual disappearance of urban life. The name of the period refers to the movement of so-called barbarian peoples—including the Huns, Goths, Vandals, Bulgars, Alani, Suebi, and Franks—into what had been the Western Roman Empire. The term “Dark Ages” is now rarely used by historians because of the value judgment it implies. Though sometimes taken to derive its meaning from the dearth of information about the period, the term’s more usual and pejorative sense is of a period of intellectual darkness and barbarity.

"They went to the temple area together every day and prayed." The first Christians lived with the traditional Jewish forms of piety, but a new form of worship was added - the celebration of the breaking of the bread which later became the Eucharist. Christian hymns developed later, the earliest of which were the "Magnificat" and the "Benedictus," while the "Lord's Prayer" was a typical petition prayer in the synagogue.explain briefly​</h2><br />

                            19. Verse 46 In the beginning, the Mother Church at Jerusalem still participated in the Jewish worship in the temple. "They went to the temple area together every day and prayed.” The first Christians lived with the traditional Jewish forms of piety, but a new form of worship was added - the celebration of the breaking of the bread which later became the Eucharist. Christian hymns developed later, the earliest of which were the "Magnificat” and the “Benedictus," while the "Lord's Prayer" was a typical petition prayer in the synagogue.explain briefly​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:Judaism, as the Jewish religion came to be known in the 1st century CE, was based on ancient Israelite religion, shorn of many of its Canaanite characteristics but with the addition of important features from Babylonia and Persia. The Jews differed from other people in the ancient world because they believed that there was only one God. Like other people, they worshipped their God with animal sacrifices offered at a temple, but, unlike others, they had only one temple, which was in Jerusalem. The sanctuary of the Jewish temple had two rooms, as did many of the other temples in the ancient world, but the second room of the Jewish temple was empty. There was no idol representing the God of Israel. The Jews also believed that they had been specially chosen by the one God of the universe to serve him and obey his laws. Although set apart from other people, they believed God called on them to be a “light to the Gentiles” and lead them to accept the God of Israel as the only God.</strong></p><p></p><p><strong>Explanation:that is the answer</strong></p><p></p><p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>thank sa point</p><p></p><p></p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p><strong> </strong><strong>God bless</strong></p><p><strong>don't</strong><strong> </strong><strong>forget</strong><strong> to</strong><strong> </strong><strong>Stan </strong><strong>IVE </strong></p><p><strong>and </strong><strong>don't</strong><strong> </strong><strong>be </strong><strong>angry</strong><strong> </strong><strong>of </strong><strong>me </strong><strong>ok</strong></p><p></p><br />
