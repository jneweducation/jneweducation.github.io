                            8. Political Legitimacy is defined as the belief that a rule,institution, or leader had the right to govern. It is a judgement by an individual about the rigthfulness of a hierachy between rule or ruler and its subject and in general, legitimacy is a collective belief held by citizens to acknowledge and respect the leadership of a particular individual or a group of people. This means that when people deem a leadership to be legitimate, they try to follow the rules and regulations imposed upon them to govern their day-to-day activities. This creates an atmosphere of stability and social order. To a certain degree, political legitimacy allows a society to operate eithin the context of an organized political structure.
Summarized and explain what you understand in this topic.</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p></p><p><strong>Legitimacy is a belief, held by individuals, about the rightfulness of a rule or ruler. It has collective effects when it is widely shared in a society. In domestic political life, these effects may include a stable social order that appears consensual. This is what we mean when we speak of a ‘legitimate regime’ and ‘legitimate authority,’ and it is what we strive for in post-conflict societies. In international political life, the effects of collectively held legitimated rules include social order but also perhaps the end of international anarchy. Since the concept of ‘anarchy’ among states depends on the absence of legitimate rule, the degree to which international structures of authority are believed to be legitimate is also the degree to which the international system cannot be considered anarchic.</strong></p><p></p><br />
