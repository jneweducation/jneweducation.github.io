This section may be used to increase the clarity and readability of assembly drawings. projection is a representation of separate views of an object on a two-dimensional surface. It reveals the width, depth and height of an object. The projection is achieved by viewing the object from a point assumed to be at infinity (an indefinitely great distance away). The line of sight or projectors are parallel to each other and perpendicular to the plane of projection. O.

Art history allows us to look back and understand how our civilization evolved over the centuries. It is a wayto know ourselves better.2. Egyptian civilization was one of the early civilizations that have greatly contributed in the development of art,religion, science, and technology of the world.3. Greek emperor erected huge halls and arenas for Gladiator, traditional fight against two slaves or criminals.4. Looking at art from the past contributes to who we are as people.5. In Gothic Era, paintings may be more an artifact of the archeological evidence than a true picture ofhumans' first created art.6. Archaeologists believed that Pre-historic sculpture is a result of natural erosion and not of human artistry.7. Paintings during the Prehistoric era were most commonly found in vases, panels and tomb and painted theireveryday scene.8. Greek used most common motifs like scenes from the life of women, mythological beings or a scene frommythical story or event.9. Since during Gothic Era, the church symbolizes the transcendence of the soul, and the underlyingphilosophy is to create buildings of height and light.10. Byzantine's advancement in developing the dome created a new style in global architecture.11. Performing art such as painting, sculpture and architecture recounts stories of our past12. Paleolithic period is the time when humans are living with animals in the cave.13. As time goes by, Gothic sculptures were given their own particular attitudes instead of being set intoparticular patterns and are more lively and realistic.14. The characteristics of Roman art are a combination of geometric regularity and keen observation of nature.15. Historians seek to explore how this art reflects the society it was created in, as well as how it influenced lifein that same society.​</a>
