                                            Individual Scientific Investigation You are going to investigate how the size of the solid being dissolved affects how fast it dissolves in water. Using the Scientific Method as a guide, you should design a simple experiment and record your results. Be sure to complete each step of the scientific method in order. You should submit a written or typed report to be graded. Remember that you should have stated in your conclusions whether the hypothesis was accepted or rejected and have provided suggestions for further experimentation. The written report will be rated using the scoring rubric. Procedure 1. Obtain the two materials and examine them closely: granules of table salt (uncrushed) and crushed table salt. 2. Write a hypothesis in a testable form. Describe a test you could conduct to find out which of the two materials dissolves faster. O 3. Identify the variable that you need to control to have a fair test. 4. Identify the independent (manipulated/cause) and dependent (responding/effect) 5. List all the materials you need, including the amount. You may ask from your teacher. 6. Be sure to record all your observations and tabulate them.

1. You are going to investigate how the size of the solid being dissolved affects how fast it dissolves in water. Using the Scientific Method as a guide, you should design a simple experiment and record your results. Be sure to complete each step of the scientific method in order. You should submit a written or typed report to be graded. Remember that you should have stated in your conclusions whether the hypothesis was accepted or rejected, and have provided suggestions for further experimentation. The written report will be rated using the scoring rubric.
 Procedure 1. Obtain the two materials and examine them closely: granules of table salt (uncrushed) and crushed table salt. 
2. Write a hypothesis in testable form. Describe a test you could conduct to find out which of the two materials dissolves faster.
 3. Identify the variable that you need to control in order to have a fair test. 
4. Identify the independent (manipulated/cause) and dependent (responding/effect) 5. List all the materials you need, including the amount. You may ask your teacher. 
6. Be sure to record all your observations and tabulate them. Write everything that you observed during the dissolving test.</a>

                                            excerpt from "Elizabeth Blackwell: A Pioneering Physician"
Many of the students, teachers, and townspeople were shocked and angry when she arrived. Some students called her names. One teacher refused to let Elizabeth into his classroom. The townspeople stared at her and muttered rude things about her. Some children even chased her through the streets, screeching, “Doctor in petticoats! Doctor in petticoats!”
excerpt from Pioneer Work in Opening the Medical Profession to Women
I had not the slightest idea of the commotion created by my appearance as a medical student in the little town. Very slowly I perceived that a doctor's wife at the table avoided any communication with me, and that as I walked backwards and forwards to college the ladies stopped to stare at me, as at a curious animal. I afterwards found that I had so shocked Geneva propriety that the theory was fully established either that I was a bad woman, whose designs would gradually become evident, or that, being insane, an outbreak of insanity would soon be apparent.
Question
How do the texts describe the town’s reaction when Elizabeth moves there to attend medical school?
please choose two correct answers
-Both texts tell ways that the people in town are disrespectful to Elizabeth.
-The first text explains that Elizabeth is teased by adults, the second does not.
-The first text tells how people at school treat Elizabeth, the second does not.
-Both texts explain that the people in town are kind Elizabeth once they get to know her.</a>

                                            Alexander wonders if the amount of sugar used in the recipe will affect the size ofthe "pandesal”? He researches the areas of baking and fermentation and tries to come upwith a way to test his question. He keeps all of his information on this topic in a journal.Alexander talks with his teacher and she gives him an Experimental Design Diagram tohelp him set up his investigation. After talking with his teacher and conducting furtherresearch, he comes up with a hypothesis. "If more sugar is added, then the pandesal willrise higher." His teacher helps him come up with a procedure and list of needed materials.She discusses with Alexander on how to determine the control group. Because hisgrandmother always used 50g of sugar in her recipe, Alexander is going to use thatamount in his control group. Alexander's teacher reminds him to keep all other factors thesame so that any observed changes in the pandesal can be attributed to the variation in theamount of sugar. The constants in an experiment are all the factors that the experimenterattempts to keep the same. They might include other ingredients to the pandesal recipe,oven used, rise time, brand of ingredients, cooking time, type of pan used, air temperatureand humidity where the pandesal was rising, oven temperature, age of the yeast.Alexander writes out his procedure for his experiment along with a materials list in hisjournal. He has both of these checked by his teacher where she checks for any safetyconcerns. Trials refer to replicate groups that are exposed to the same conditions in anexperiment. Alexander is going to test each sugar variable 3 times. He comes up with atable he can use to record his data. He gets all his materials together and carries out hisexperiment. Alexander finds that 85g of sugar produces the largest pandesal. Hishypothesis is accepted. Alexander tells his grandmother about his findings and prepares topresent his project in Science class.​</a>

Using the Scientific Method as a guide, you should design a simple experiment and record your results. Be sure to complete each step of the scientific method in order. You should submit a written or typed report to be graded. Remember that you should have stated in your conclusions whether the hypothesis was accepted or rejected and have provided suggestions for further experimentation. The written report. will be rated using the scoring rubric. Procedure 1. Obtain the two materials and examine them closely: granules of table salt (uncrushed) and crushed table salt. 2. Write a hypothesis in a testable form. Describe a test you could conduct to find out which of the two materials dissolves faster. O 3. Identify the variable that you need to control to have a fair test. 4. Identify the independent (manipulated/cause) and dependent (responding/effect) 5. List all the materials you need, including the amount. You may ask from your teacher. 6. Be sure to record all your observations and tabulate them.

                            14. PA HELP PO PLS--
1. You are going to investigate how the size of the solid being dissolved affects how fast it dissolves in water. Using the Scientific Method as a guide, you should design a simple experiment and record your results. Be sure to complete each step of the scientific method in order. You should submit a written or typed report to be graded. Remember that you should have stated in your conclusions whether the hypothesis was accepted or rejected, and have provided suggestions for further experimentation. The written report will be rated using the scoring rubric.
 Procedure 1. Obtain the two materials and examine them closely: granules of table salt (uncrushed) and crushed table salt. 
2. Write a hypothesis in testable form. Describe a test you could conduct to find out which of the two materials dissolves faster.
 3. Identify the variable that you need to control in order to have a fair test. 
4. Identify the independent (manipulated/cause) and dependent (responding/effect) 5. List all the materials you need, including the amount. You may ask your teacher. 
6. Be sure to record all your observations and tabulate them. Write everything that you observed during the dissolving test.</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Size of the particles -- When a solute dissolves, the action takes place only at the surface of each particle. When the total surface area of the solute particles is increased, the solute dissolves more rapidly. Breaking a solute into smaller pieces increases its surface area and increases its rate of solution.</p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>COMMUNITIES HAVE PROBLEMS, JUST LIKE PEOPLE</p><p></p><p>Problems are part of life. We all deal with individual problems, families have family issues, and communities have community problems. Communities must come together to solve their problems, just like families.</p><p>When communities try to solve problems, they start just like individuals do. They must reflect and analyze the issue to help come to a solution. But, before discussing solutions, problems must be identified.</p><p>So, after discussing a little bit about what problems look like, this section will explain what analyzing community problems is about, why it can be helpful, and then how to do it.</p><p>WHAT IS A COMMUNITY PROBLEM?</p><p></p><p>Problems can arise in any part of a community and come from any aspect of community life. There's a long list of nominees, and you probably know some of the main contenders. Can you name the leading problems in your community? Chances are you can at least start the list.</p><p>Below are examples of community problems:</p><p></p><p>Example Community Problems: Adolescent pregnancy, access to clean drinking water, child abuse and neglect, crime, domestic violence, drug use, pollution, mismanagement of resources, lack of funding for schools and services, ethnic conflict, health disparities, HIV/ AIDS, hunger, inadequate emergency services, inequality, jobs, lack of affordable housing, poverty,  transportation, violence, racism and police brutality.</p><p></p><p>WHAT OTHERS WOULD YOU ADD?</p><p></p><p>Rather than aim for a complete problem list, here are some criteria you may consider when identifying community problems:</p><p></p><p>The problem occurs too frequently (frequency)</p><p></p><p>The problem has lasted for a while (duration)</p><p></p><p>The problem affects many people (scope, or range)</p><p></p><p>The problem is disrupting to personal or community life, and possibly intense (severity)</p><p></p><p>The problem deprives people of legal or moral rights (equity)</p><p></p><p>The issue is perceived as a problem (perception)</p><p></p><p>This last criterion, perception, is an important one, and can also help indicate readiness for addressing the issue within the community.</p><p>What is seen as a problem can vary from place to place and group to group in the same community. Although there's no official definition of a community problem, the above examples and criteria above should help you begin to name and analyze community problems.</p><p>WHY SHOULD I ANALYZE A COMMUNITY PROBLEM?</p><p></p><p>Analyzing community problems is a way of thinking carefully about a problem or issue before acting on a solution. It first involves identifying reasons a problem exists and then, identifying possible solutions and a plan for improvement.</p><p>Example: The downtown area of a community is declining. Stores are closing, and moving out; no new stores are moving in. We want to revitalize that downtown. How should we do it?</p><p></p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>paki brainliest nalang po please</p><p></p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Research Title: Understanding the Factors Influencing Female Students' Interest and Performance in STEM: A Mixed-Methods Study.</p><p></p><p>Introduction and Rationale:</p><p></p><p>STEM education, which prepares students for employment in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics, has grown in importance in today's culture. However, research has revealed that there is a considerable gender gap in STEM professions, with women underrepresented. This gender disparity has been blamed on a number of issues, including gender stereotypes, a lack of role models, and unconscious bias in the classroom. The goal of this research is to look at what factors influence female students' interest and performance in STEM disciplines. We can create methods and interventions to improve female involvement and success in STEM disciplines by acquiring a greater understanding of these characteristics. A mixed-methods approach will be used in this study, which will include surveys and interviews with female STEM students and their teachers. The collected data will be examined in order to uncover common themes and patterns that emerge, as well as to develop suggestions for best practices in STEM education for girls. This study is significant because it tackles an essential issue in STEM education and has the potential to improve policies and practices aimed at increasing female involvement and performance in STEM disciplines.</p><p></p><p>I apologize I do not know your track/strand, thus I chose STEM as a research topic! ^^</p><p></p><p></p><br />

                            18. excerpt from "Elizabeth Blackwell: A Pioneering Physician"
Many of the students, teachers, and townspeople were shocked and angry when she arrived. Some students called her names. One teacher refused to let Elizabeth into his classroom. The townspeople stared at her and muttered rude things about her. Some children even chased her through the streets, screeching, “Doctor in petticoats! Doctor in petticoats!”
excerpt from Pioneer Work in Opening the Medical Profession to Women
I had not the slightest idea of the commotion created by my appearance as a medical student in the little town. Very slowly I perceived that a doctor's wife at the table avoided any communication with me, and that as I walked backwards and forwards to college the ladies stopped to stare at me, as at a curious animal. I afterwards found that I had so shocked Geneva propriety that the theory was fully established either that I was a bad woman, whose designs would gradually become evident, or that, being insane, an outbreak of insanity would soon be apparent.
Question
How do the texts describe the town’s reaction when Elizabeth moves there to attend medical school?
please choose two correct answers
-Both texts tell ways that the people in town are disrespectful to Elizabeth.
-The first text explains that Elizabeth is teased by adults, the second does not.
-The first text tells how people at school treat Elizabeth, the second does not.
-Both texts explain that the people in town are kind Elizabeth once they get to know her.</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer: -Both texts tell ways that the people in town are disrespectful to Elizabeth.</strong></p><p><strong>-The first text tells how people at school treat Elizabeth, the second does not.</strong></p><p></p><p><strong>Explanation: I chose the first option, "Both texts tell ways that the people in town are disrespectful to Elizabeth," because both excerpts mention that the people in town reacted negatively to Elizabeth's presence. In the first text, many students, teachers, and townspeople were shocked and angry when she arrived, some called her names, one teacher refused to let her into his classroom, and some children even chased her through the streets. In the second text, Elizabeth herself states that the ladies stopped to stare at her as if she were a curious animal and that she had shocked Geneva's propriety so much that people had established theories that she was either a bad woman or insane.</strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong>I also chose the third option, "The first text tells how people at school treat Elizabeth, the second does not," because only the first text describes how students and teachers at the school treated Elizabeth. The second text, on the other hand, focuses more on the reaction of the townspeople and the negative impact it had on Elizabeth's reputation.</strong></p><p></p><br />

                            29. Alexander wonders if the amount of sugar used in the recipe will affect the size ofthe "pandesal”? He researches the areas of baking and fermentation and tries to come upwith a way to test his question. He keeps all of his information on this topic in a journal.Alexander talks with his teacher and she gives him an Experimental Design Diagram tohelp him set up his investigation. After talking with his teacher and conducting furtherresearch, he comes up with a hypothesis. "If more sugar is added, then the pandesal willrise higher." His teacher helps him come up with a procedure and list of needed materials.She discusses with Alexander on how to determine the control group. Because hisgrandmother always used 50g of sugar in her recipe, Alexander is going to use thatamount in his control group. Alexander's teacher reminds him to keep all other factors thesame so that any observed changes in the pandesal can be attributed to the variation in theamount of sugar. The constants in an experiment are all the factors that the experimenterattempts to keep the same. They might include other ingredients to the pandesal recipe,oven used, rise time, brand of ingredients, cooking time, type of pan used, air temperatureand humidity where the pandesal was rising, oven temperature, age of the yeast.Alexander writes out his procedure for his experiment along with a materials list in hisjournal. He has both of these checked by his teacher where she checks for any safetyconcerns. Trials refer to replicate groups that are exposed to the same conditions in anexperiment. Alexander is going to test each sugar variable 3 times. He comes up with atable he can use to record his data. He gets all his materials together and carries out hisexperiment. Alexander finds that 85g of sugar produces the largest pandesal. Hishypothesis is accepted. Alexander tells his grandmother about his findings and prepares topresent his project in Science class.​</h2><br />

                            30. Investigation You are going to investigate how the size of the solid being dissolved affects how fast it dissolves in water. Using the Scientific Method as a guide, you should design a simple experiment and record your results. Be sure to complete each step of the scientific method in order. You should submit a written or typed report to be graded. Remember that you should have stated in your conclusions whether the hypothesis was accepted or rejected and have provided suggestions for further experimentation. The written report. will be rated using the scoring rubric. Procedure 1. Obtain the two materials and examine them closely: granules of table salt (uncrushed) and crushed table salt. 2. Write a hypothesis in a testable form. Describe a test you could conduct to find out which of the two materials dissolves faster. O 3. Identify the variable that you need to control to have a fair test. 4. Identify the independent (manipulated/cause) and dependent (responding/effect) 5. List all the materials you need, including the amount. You may ask from your teacher. 6. Be sure to record all your observations and tabulate them. Write everything that you observed during the dissolving test.​</h2><br />
