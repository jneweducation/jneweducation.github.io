                        Since the unit of measure of the cylindrical tank is in "feet",<br />the volume of it is 28[tex] \pi [/tex] ft and its volume in meters is 8.1680352768. Rounded off to the nearest whole number, it is 8 cubic meters.<br /><br />on the other hand, the volume of the rectangular prism is 4 cubic meters.<br /><br />Thus, the cylindrical water tank can hold more water about 4 cubic meter difference.<br /><br /><br />
