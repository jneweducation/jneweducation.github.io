The train operator wants to know the exact location that the express train reaches for every hour interval of travel and the approximate time that the express train takes to reach Naga so he asked your help to provide him a complete table that shows the distance travelled by the express train in 1, 2, 3, and 4 hours. To do this, you thought of creating a graph for the table of values that you will make to give the train operator a clearer presentation of data. You are to use the values in the table to create the graph (on a Cartesian Plane) that shows the relationship between the time and the distance travelled by the express train. You are to use the graph to determine how long it will take the express train to reach Naga, approximately 384 km away from Manila. Make sure that your table of values is correct and your graph is accurately constructed.​</a>

                            27. You are the mechanical engineer in charge is of the express train that travels with an average speed of 120 kilometers per hour (km/h) from Manila to Naga. The train operator wants to know the exact location that the express train reaches for every hour interval of travel and the approximate time that the express train takes to reach Naga so he asked your help to provide him a complete table that shows the distance travelled by the express train in 1, 2, 3, and 4 hours. To do this, you thought of creating a graph for the table of values that you will make to give the train operator a clearer presentation of data. You are to use the values in the table to create the graph (on a Cartesian Plane) that shows the relationship between the time and the distance travelled by the express train. You are to use the graph to determine how long it will take the express train to reach Naga, approximately 384 km away from Manila. Make sure that your table of values is correct and your graph is accurately constructed.​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>To create a table of values for the distance traveled by the express train in 1, 2, 3, and 4 hours, we can use the formula: Distance = Speed x Time.</p><p></p><p>Hours	Distance (km)</p><p>1	120 km</p><p>2	240 km</p><p>3	360 km</p><p>4	480 km</p><p>To create a graph of these values on a Cartesian Plane, we would plot the hours on the x-axis and the distance on the y-axis. Each point on the graph would represent the distance traveled at a given hour, with the points (1, 120), (2, 240), (3, 360), and (4, 480).</p><p></p><p>To determine how long it will take the express train to reach Naga, we can look at the graph and see that when the distance traveled reaches 384 km, it will have taken the train approximately 3.2 hours to reach Naga.</p><p></p><p>It's important to note that this is an approximation, as the speed of the train may vary depending on various factors such as traffic, weather, and the condition of the tracks. The train operator should also consider other factors such as stops and delays in travel time</p><p>To create the table of values, we can use the formula: Distance = Speed x Time. In this case, the speed is 120 km/h and we are given the time in hours.</p><p></p><p>Table of Values:</p><p>Time (hours) Distance (km)</p><p>1 120</p><p>2 240</p><p>3 360</p><p>4 480</p><p></p><p>To create a graph, we can plot the time (x-axis) and distance (y-axis) values on a Cartesian plane.</p><p></p><p>Graph:</p><p>x-axis: Time (hours)</p><p>y-axis: Distance (km)</p><p></p><p>Plot the points: (1,120), (2,240), (3,360), (4,480)</p><p></p><p>To determine how long it will take the express train to reach Naga, we can use the formula: Distance = Speed x Time. Since we know the distance (384 km) and the speed (120 km/h), we can solve for time by dividing the distance by the speed:</p><p>Time = Distance / Speed</p><p>Time = 384 / 120</p><p>Time = 3.2 hours approximately</p><p></p><p>So, it will take approximately 3.2 hours for the express train to reach Naga.</p><br />
