                                            How the Moon and the Stars Came to Be Bukidnon (Mindanao) One day in the times when the sky was close to the ground a spinster went out to pound rice.1 Before she began her work, she took off the beads from around her neck and the comb from her hair, and hung them on the sky, which at that time looked like coral rock. Then she began working, and each time that she raised her pestle into the air it struck the sky. For some time she pounded the rice, and then she raised the pestle so high that it struck the sky very hard. Immediately the sky began to rise,2 and it went up so far that she lost her ornaments. Never did they come down, for the comb became the moon and the beads are the stars that are scattered about.[125]What is the theme??please​</a>

Theystarted building it in the year 70. It took ten years to build. It is still around today. The Coliseum has been usedin many ways. In ancient Rome, men fought each other in it. They fought against lions, tigers, and bears. Ohmy! It was dreadful. But most of the people loved it. As many as 80,000 Romans would pack inside to watch.These gruesome events went on until 523. The Coliseum has been damaged many times over the years. It wasstruck by lightning in the year 217. This started a fire. Much of the Coliseum is made of stone. But the firedamaged the upper levels. They were made of wood. This damage took many years to repair. It was not finisheduntil the year 240. The worst damage happened in 1349. A mighty earthquake shook Rome and the Coliseum.The south side of the building collapsed. Pieces of the arena were all over the ground. Many people took thefallen stones. Others took stones from the seating areas. They used them to repair houses and churches. TheRomans of those days were not connected to the Coliseum. It had last been used as a castle. Before that it wasa graveyard. It has been hundreds of years since the games. The damage to the Coliseum was never repaired.It's a good thing the outer wall of it still stands strong. Today the Coliseum is one of Rome's most popularattractions. People from all over the world come to Italy to see it. The Pope leads a big march around it everyGood Friday, It is a symbol that many know. It has even appeared on the back of a coin. I guess that makes ita symbol that many people want too.Ang question po nasa picture! Thank you!! ​</a>

                                            The Origin of Rice and Small Streams
Once upon a time, there were two blind women. They were kindhearted, but
they were very poor. In order to eat, they had to beg from their neighbors and
sometimes they were driven away or given nothing. Nevertheless, they did not
complain but went on living each day as best as they could.
Once when they had no food for some time, they decided to walk to the next
village to try their luck there. They walked slowly, feeling for footholds among the hilly
paths. When they had walked some distance, they bumped into a large rock. The
impact sent their bodies reeling. Dazed, they held on to each other and tried to get
back on their feet. But they had gone too long without food, and now they could not
even stand.
The rock opened magically, and out of its granite depths a young woman
emerged. She took the two blind women by the hand and let them inside. An old
woman seated them at a stone table and gave them food to eat. "Now tell me what
you need," said the old woman to them when they had finished their meal.
One of the blind women said, "I am always hungry. I need food, but I am blind
and I cannot work for a living in the fields."
The other replied, "I am always thirsty. I always need something to drink, but I,
too, am blind and I cannot find my way even to the smallest spring."
The old woman gave the first woman a sack of rice that would never be empty.
To the other she gave a bottle of water that would never be drained dry. They both
thanked the old woman profusely and felt their way back home. They lived together
happily, never wanting anything more than what they already had.
After some time, though, they told each other that it was not right to keep to
themselves the good fortune that they had been given. So the one who owned the
magic sack of rice took a handful of grain and sowed it; when the grain was harvested,
she gave it to the people in the village. The one who owned the magic bottle poured
some of the water out onto the land where it changed into many small brooks and
streams. On their banks flowers soon grew, and to the streams people came to fetch
water for their various needs.</a>

His uncle Juanito wrote him to come to Manila, "I want you to come and help me in my furniture shop," he wrote. "I'm sending you your train fare. Call me when you leave. I'll meet you at the station." So one bright day, Petros took a bus for the nearest town. He had taken a bus a few times before. But he never enjoyed any of those trips because the bus was to crowded for comfort. He did not mind any discomfort on that day, for he was at last going to Manila, the city of his dreams! Petros had to wait at the station for more than three hours. He had lunch and a short nap when the train finally arrived. How wonderful his trip was! He wondered at the speed it took the train to reach the city. He wondered at the varied things he saw on the way. After he had satisfied his thirst foe new things, he told himself, "There's nothing more exciting than leaving one's barrio for the great big city."

" throught the hare I have plenty of time to play in the meadow here and so he said. after the hare finished playing he decided that he had time to take a little nap I have plenty of time to beat that tortoise he thought. And he cuddle up against a tree and dozed. the tortoise in the meantime continued to plod on albeit it ever so slowly he never stopped but took one good step after another. the hare finally woke from his nap "time to get going", he thought. and off he went faster than he had ever run before! He dashed as quickly as anyone ever could up to the finish line where he met the tortoise who was patiently awaiting his arrival. LOOK AT THE PICTURE PLEASE☑️️​</a>

                            13. The ColiseumThe Coliseum is an ancient stadium in the center of Rome. It is the largest of its kind. It is very old. Theystarted building it in the year 70. It took ten years to build. It is still around today. The Coliseum has been usedin many ways. In ancient Rome, men fought each other in it. They fought against lions, tigers, and bears. Ohmy! It was dreadful. But most of the people loved it. As many as 80,000 Romans would pack inside to watch.These gruesome events went on until 523. The Coliseum has been damaged many times over the years. It wasstruck by lightning in the year 217. This started a fire. Much of the Coliseum is made of stone. But the firedamaged the upper levels. They were made of wood. This damage took many years to repair. It was not finisheduntil the year 240. The worst damage happened in 1349. A mighty earthquake shook Rome and the Coliseum.The south side of the building collapsed. Pieces of the arena were all over the ground. Many people took thefallen stones. Others took stones from the seating areas. They used them to repair houses and churches. TheRomans of those days were not connected to the Coliseum. It had last been used as a castle. Before that it wasa graveyard. It has been hundreds of years since the games. The damage to the Coliseum was never repaired.It's a good thing the outer wall of it still stands strong. Today the Coliseum is one of Rome's most popularattractions. People from all over the world come to Italy to see it. The Pope leads a big march around it everyGood Friday, It is a symbol that many know. It has even appeared on the back of a coin. I guess that makes ita symbol that many people want too.Ang question po nasa picture! Thank you!! ​</h2><br />

                            15. The Origin of Rice and Small Streams
Once upon a time, there were two blind women. They were kindhearted, but
they were very poor. In order to eat, they had to beg from their neighbors and
sometimes they were driven away or given nothing. Nevertheless, they did not
complain but went on living each day as best as they could.
Once when they had no food for some time, they decided to walk to the next
village to try their luck there. They walked slowly, feeling for footholds among the hilly
paths. When they had walked some distance, they bumped into a large rock. The
impact sent their bodies reeling. Dazed, they held on to each other and tried to get
back on their feet. But they had gone too long without food, and now they could not
even stand.
The rock opened magically, and out of its granite depths a young woman
emerged. She took the two blind women by the hand and let them inside. An old
woman seated them at a stone table and gave them food to eat. "Now tell me what
you need," said the old woman to them when they had finished their meal.
One of the blind women said, "I am always hungry. I need food, but I am blind
and I cannot work for a living in the fields."
The other replied, "I am always thirsty. I always need something to drink, but I,
too, am blind and I cannot find my way even to the smallest spring."
The old woman gave the first woman a sack of rice that would never be empty.
To the other she gave a bottle of water that would never be drained dry. They both
thanked the old woman profusely and felt their way back home. They lived together
happily, never wanting anything more than what they already had.
After some time, though, they told each other that it was not right to keep to
themselves the good fortune that they had been given. So the one who owned the
magic sack of rice took a handful of grain and sowed it; when the grain was harvested,
she gave it to the people in the village. The one who owned the magic bottle poured
some of the water out onto the land where it changed into many small brooks and
streams. On their banks flowers soon grew, and to the streams people came to fetch
water for their various needs.</h2><br />

His uncle Juanito wrote him to come to Manila, "I want you to come and help me in my furniture shop," he wrote. "I'm sending you your train fare. Call me when you leave. I'll meet you at the station." So one bright day, Petros took a bus for the nearest town. He had taken a bus a few times before. But he never enjoyed any of those trips because the bus was to crowded for comfort. He did not mind any discomfort on that day, for he was at last going to Manila, the city of his dreams! Petros had to wait at the station for more than three hours. He had lunch and a short nap when the train finally arrived. How wonderful his trip was! He wondered at the speed it took the train to reach the city. He wondered at the varied things he saw on the way. After he had satisfied his thirst foe new things, he told himself, "There's nothing more exciting than leaving one's barrio for the great big city."

                            20. Once upon a time, there were two blind women. They were kindhearted, but they were very poor. In order to eat, they had to beg from their neighbors and sometimes they were driven away or given nothing. Nevertheless, they did not complain but went on living each day as best as they could. Once when they had no food for some time, they decided to walk to the next village to try their luck there. They walked slowly, feeling for footholds among the hilly paths. When they had walked some distance, they bumped into a large rock. The impact sent their bodies reeling. Dazed, they held on to each other and tried to get back on their feet. But they had gone too long without food, and now they could not even stand. The rock opened magically, and out of its granite depths a young woman emerged. She took the two blind women by the hand and let them inside. An old woman seated them at a stone table and gave them food to eat. “Now tell me what you need,” said the old woman to them when they had finished their meal. One of the blind women said, “I am always hungry. I need food, but I am blind and I cannot work for a living in the fields.” The other replied, “I am always thirsty. I always need something to drink, but I, too, am blind and I cannot find my way even to the smallest spring.” The old woman gave the first woman a sack of rice that would never be empty. To the other she gave a bottle of water that would never be drained dry. They both thanked the old woman profusely and felt their way back home. They lived together happily, never wanting anything more than what they already had. After some time, though, they told each other that it was not right to keep to themselves the good fortune that they had been given. So the one who owned the magic sack of rice took a handful of grain and sowed it; when the grain was harvested, she gave it to the people in the village. The one who owned the magic bottle poured some of the water out onto the land where it changed into many small brooks and streams. On their banks flowers soon grew, and to the streams people came to fetch water for their various needs. Answer these questions orally. 1.When did the story happen?2. Who were the characters?3.

                            30. Joko liked playing board games, but he hated losing. He hated losing so much that he would do whatever it took to win, even bending or breaking the rules. He'd steal money from his father and hide it under the couch cushions. He’d skip spaces while he was moving around the board, He’d shortchange others’ money that they owed and argued with them about it. Techniques were effective. He did win most of the games that he played, but the people whom he played with were his friends and family, and it didn’t take too long until they caught on to his tricks. They tried to tell Joko to stop cheating. They said the game wasn’t any fun when he cheated, but he didn’t listen. He continued with his treacherous style of game play, until nobody would play with him anymore. Joko may have won a lot of games, but at what cost? * A. Be smart B. Cheater never prospersC.
