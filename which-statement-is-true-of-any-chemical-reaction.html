During the interphase, RNA exists as chromatin rather than as chromosomes_____2. A condensed chromosome is made up of four identical sister chromatidsthat are densly packed and constricted in a region termed as centromere._____3. Telophase begins when the chromosomes at the start of each pole decondense._____4. In order to finally create two new cells, symbiosis should take place._____5. For some animal cells, cytokinesis is initiated during metaphase where the plane of cleavage is set at right angle to the mitotic spindles._____6. Ribonucleic acid contains the hereditary material in nearly all organisms_____7. In plants, mitosis is used to repair damaged cells such as when they are wounded or badly injured_____8. Cells that are damaged and lost will be replenished when cells collide._____9. Mitosis is the process in the water cycle that forms identical daughter cells and retains a similar copy of the DNA._____10. In plants, mitosis of nerve tissues is important so as the plants sustain its growth._____11. There are substances like amino acids, glucose and some ions that cannot diffuse freely across the plasma membrane because of the hydrophilic nature of the lipid bilayer. _____12. The hydrophilic region is in the form of a head while the hydrophobic part contains two tails of amino acids. _____13. Phospholipids and carbohydrates are the principal components of membranes_____14. Generally, a phospholipid molecule having both hydrophobic and hydrophilic heads forms the endoplasmic reticulum_____15. The structure of the cell membrane plays active and vigor roles in the transport of substances across it._____16. During the intake of large molecules or exocytosis, the portion of the plasma membrane invaginates to enclose the substance _____17. If diffusion is taking place across a semi-permeable membrane, the transport is called cell cycle._____18. Proteins can actively pump the molecules coupled with ATP hydrolysis (transport ATPases) and possibly move molecules by cytokinesis _____19. In other instances, receptor-mediated exocytosis occurs wherein the molecules can bind to the surface of the membrane _____20.  Receptor-mediated transport is not compatible with all large molecules due to the specificity of adaptors, similar to the behavior of enzymes._____21. Enzymes are proteins that catalyze chemical reactions by decreasing the activation energy that is needed for the occurrence of any chemical reaction._____22. There are 22 different digestive enzymes that our human body produces_____23. The induced fit model was proposed by Daniel Koshland is 1958 which suggests that the active site is continuously reshaped by interactions with the substrate interacts with the enzyme_____24. The temperature at which the maximum rate of reaction occurs is called the enzymes optimum pressure_____25. Most Enzyme in the human body have an optimum temperature at around 37 degrees Celsius.​</a>

During the interphase, RNA exists as chromatin rather than as chromosomes_____2. A condensed chromosome is made up of four identical sister chromatidsthat are densly packed and constricted in a region termed as centromere._____3. Telophase begins when the chromosomes at the start of each pole decondense._____4. In order to finally create two new cells, symbiosis should take place._____5. For some animal cells, cytokinesis is initiated during metaphase where the plane of cleavage is set at right angle to the mitotic spindles._____6. Ribonucleic acid contains the hereditary material in nearly all organisms_____7. In plants, mitosis is used to repair damaged cells such as when they are wounded or badly injured_____8. Cells that are damaged and lost will be replenished when cells collide._____9. Mitosis is the process in the water cycle that forms identical daughter cells and retains a similar copy of the DNA._____10. In plants, mitosis of nerve tissues is important so as the plants sustain its growth._____11. There are substances like amino acids, glucose and some ions that cannot diffuse freely across the plasma membrane because of the hydrophilic nature of the lipid bilayer. _____12. The hydrophilic region is in the form of a head while the hydrophobic part contains two tails of amino acids. _____13. Phospholipids and carbohydrates are the principal components of membranes_____14. Generally, a phospholipid molecule having both hydrophobic and hydrophilic heads forms the endoplasmic reticulum_____15. The structure of the cell membrane plays active and vigor roles in the transport of substances across it._____16. During the intake of large molecules or exocytosis, the portion of the plasma membrane invaginates to enclose the substance _____17. If diffusion is taking place across a semi-permeable membrane, the transport is called cell cycle._____18. Proteins can actively pump the molecules coupled with ATP hydrolysis (transport ATPases) and possibly move molecules by cytokinesis _____19. In other instances, receptor-mediated exocytosis occurs wherein the molecules can bind to the surface of the membrane _____20.  Receptor-mediated transport is not compatible with all large molecules due to the specificity of adaptors, similar to the behavior of enzymes._____21. Enzymes are proteins that catalyze chemical reactions by decreasing the activation energy that is needed for the occurrence of any chemical reaction._____22. There are 22 different digestive enzymes that our human body produces_____23. The induced fit model was proposed by Daniel Koshland is 1958 which suggests that the active site is continuously reshaped by interactions with the substrate interacts with the enzyme_____24.

_____2. A condensed chromosome is made up of four identical sister chromatids
that are densly packed and constricted in a region termed as centromere.
_____3. Telophase begins when the chromosomes at the start of each pole decondense.
_____4. In order to finally create two new cells, symbiosis should take place.
_____5. For some animal cells, cytokinesis is initiated during metaphase where the plane of cleavage is set at right angle to the mitotic spindles.
_____6. Ribonucleic acid contains the hereditary material in nearly all organisms
_____7. In plants, mitosis is used to repair damaged cells such as when they are wounded or badly injured
_____8. Cells that are damaged and lost will be replenished when cells collide.
_____9. Mitosis is the process in the water cycle that forms identical daughter cells and retains a similar copy of the DNA.
_____10. In plants, mitosis of nerve tissues is important so as the plants sustain its growth.
_____11. There are substances like amino acids, glucose and some ions that cannot diffuse freely across the plasma membrane because of the hydrophilic nature of the lipid bilayer. 
_____12. The hydrophilic region is in the form of a head while the hydrophobic part contains two tails of amino acids. 
_____13. Phospholipids and carbohydrates are the principal components of membranes
_____14. Generally, a phospholipid molecule having both hydrophobic and hydrophilic heads forms the endoplasmic reticulum
_____15. The structure of the cell membrane plays active and vigor roles in the transport of substances across it.
_____16. During the intake of large molecules or exocytosis, the portion of the plasma membrane invaginates to enclose the substance 
_____17. If diffusion is taking place across a semi-permeable membrane, the transport is called cell cycle.
_____18. Proteins can actively pump the molecules coupled with ATP hydrolysis (transport ATPases) and possibly move molecules by cytokinesis 
_____19. In other instances, receptor-mediated exocytosis occurs wherein the molecules can bind to the surface of the membrane 
_____20.  Receptor-mediated transport is not compatible with all large molecules due to the specificity of adaptors, similar to the behavior of enzymes.
_____21. Enzymes are proteins that catalyze chemical reactions by decreasing the activation energy that is needed for the occurrence of any chemical reaction.
_____22. There are 22 different digestive enzymes that our human body produces
_____23. The induced fit model was proposed by Daniel Koshland is 1958 which suggests that the active site is continuously reshaped by interactions with the substrate interacts with the enzyme
_____24. The temperature at which the maximum rate of reaction occurs is called the enzymes optimum pressure
_____25. Most Enzyme in the human body have an optimum temperature at around 37 degrees Celsius.</h2><br />
