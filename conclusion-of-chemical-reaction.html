                                            A student observed a chemical reaction and collected the following data:
Observations before the reaction: a white powder was added to a clear liquid
Observations during the reaction: the reactants bubbled rapidly in the open beaker
Mass of reactants: 4.2 g
Mass of products: 4.0 g
The student concludes that mass was not conserved in the reaction.

Plant A was notwie w use die wuier thorougisy die water and use air at vurk it in making its fouudue to the absence of sunlight that supposedly fueled the combination of thesematerials.Plant B, on the other hand, with sufficient amount of sunlight grew healthy darkgreen leaves because the reaction took place between gases in air called carbondioxide and hydrogen, a part of water. Sunlight caused these two to combine andmade new chemicals called carbohydrates. Carbohydrates are plant food. Plants usethese chemicals to live and grow.1. What is the problem in the situation?2.

Refer to the given illustration. Write your answer on another sheet of paper How does sunlight affect the growth of a plant? In most plants, photosynthesis takes place mainly in the leaves. For photosynthesis to work, the chloroplast needs a source of energy like sunlight and ingredients such as carbon dioxide and water. When light energy carbon dioxide, and water are present, a chemical reaction takes place. Two different set-ups were prepared. Plant A and Plant B. Plant A was placed inside the box, hence, there is no I'm plant B with enough sunlight grew healthy.

What would a scientist do to best communicate these data to other scientists in a presentation?
A. Replace the table with text highlighting pressures.
B. Change the unit of pressure to atm.
C. Make a graph for better visual representation.
D. Display only rows 1, 3, and 6 of the data to simplify results.
5. A filmmaker wants to depict a realistic dramatization of a scientist making and communicating an important scientific discovery. Which plot description would best depict the methods of discovery and communication that a modern professional scientist uses?
A. The scientist collaborates with others to plan and carry out an experiment and then writes a paper that has a clear conclusion. He submits it to a professional journal for peer review, after which the results are presented publicly.
B. The scientist works with a few other scientists in a secret lab that is sponsored by a large business corporation. When the scientists have results, they contact others in the scientific community to report their results.
C. The scientist works alone in a lab until he makes a dramatic breakthrough and then immediately announces the results through a worldwide press conference.
D. The scientist seeks input and data from a wide range of people of different scientific backgrounds and then publishes all the data and results on the Internet so that all the collaborators can apply it to their individual research.
6. A recent encyclopedia entry about dogs cites multiple research papers done by scientists at veterinary schools. According to the article, Labrador retrievers come in two specific breeds: English and American. The English breed is described as stocky and heavy, while the American breed is described as tall and lanky. The article describes current scientific research as showing that males of both breeds usually weigh about 29-41 kg (65-90 lb), and females weigh 25-32 kg (55-70 lb). Coat colors for both breeds come in solid black, yellow, or chocolate. All labs have strong tails and webbed feet, which help them swim. Devon would like to use this information to determine if his new dog is an English or American Labrador retriever. 
Which best describes the reliability of the information?
A. It is not reliable because only scientists can use scientific information for reference.
B. It is not reliable because it doesn’t talk about how to test and only gives data about the breeds.
C. It is reliable because the article is based on multiple studies done by scientists at multiple veterinary schools.
D. It is reliable because it gives information about both types of Labradors in addition to information about other types of dogs.</a>

Refer to the given illustration. How does sunlight affect the growth of a plant? In most plants, photosynthesis takes place mainly in the leaves. For photosynthesis to work, the chloroplast needs a source of energy like sunlight and ingredients such as carbon dioxide and water. When light energy, carbon dioxide, and water are present, a chemical reaction takes place. Two different set-ups were prepared, Plant A and Plant B. Plant A was placed inside the box, hence, there is no air and sunlight. Plant B was placed outside the house with enough sunlight. After a week, the effect of sunlight on the growth and development of the plants was observed. Plant A, which is placed inside the box withered and died. While plant B with enough sunlight grew healthy. Therefore, it only proves that sunlight and a gas in the air has a great effect on the growth of a plant. Without sunlight and a gas from the air, plants can’t live nor grow to the fullest. Flow Chart Given Illustration Write your answer on the Flow Chart here.

                            3. conclusion about chemical reactions</h2><br />
                          In our chemical reaction lab, Mr. Casey's 2nd peiod class experimented to determine if chemical reactions happen amongst unknown substances. I predicted that there would be multiple chemical reactions, and some physical.    By conducting this experiment, we found that chemical reactions occur everywhere. We also found that you have to be patient whilst heating, in order for a reaction to transpire.  This data supported my hypothesis because multiple reactions did happen, just like I expected. In this experiment I learned that if your patient, you will witness more reactions.<br />    Some elements we couldve fixed were rushing it, slowing down the process wouldve made it more enjoyable. If there was one thing i would change, it would be the heat radiating from the candle. If the heat wouldve been 'kicked up' it wouldve made the process exceedingly faster. Further research would be to test the powders with different liquids to see if different reactions occurred.<br />    This data connects to real life because chemical reactions happen everyday! This relation is important because without them, we wouldnt have neccasary elements, such as food. Who can live without food!? As you can see, chemical reactions are a big part of our daily lives.     <br /><br /><br />

Now, to convert, we can just multiply 2.50 L x (1 quart / 0.943 L) = 2.65 quarts. Note how the "liters unit" is cancelled and we are left with quarts.</p><br /><p><strong>2. D. </strong> What is one advantage of using a computer over a graphing calculator?
</p><p>A. Computers are more useful for quick calculations.
</p><p>B. Computers are easier to transport to remote locations.
</p><p>C. Computers have lower power consumption.
</p><p>D. Computers hold larger amounts of data.</p><p>Options  A-C are actually advantages of a graphing calculator. Because it is more portable (B), it is easier to use for quick calculations (A). Since it's also smaller, it has a lower power consumption (C). Computers, however, because of their computing capacity can hold larger amounts of data.</p><br /><p><strong>3. C.</strong> Which of these steps would most likely be part of a lab procedure?
</p><p>A. Write a hypothesis to answer a question.
</p><p>B. Write a title at the top of a completed lab report.
</p><p>C. Record the time to complete a chemical reaction.
</p><p>D. Create a question on the cause of a chemical reaction.</p><p>Options A, B, and D are part of pre-lab and post-lab procedures. Only option C  actually needs to be done during the experiment. You'd need A and D (hypothesis and question) before lab, to know what to test. Option B would come after the lab experiment, because there is already a completed lab report.</p><br /><p><strong>4.C.</strong> A scientist collected the following data, which show how the pressure of water vapor changes with temperature.
</p><p>
What would a scientist do to best communicate these data to other scientists in a presentation?
</p><p>A. Replace the table with text highlighting pressures.
</p><p>B. Change the unit of pressure to atm.
</p><p>C. Make a graph for better visual representation.
</p><p>D. Display only rows 1, 3, and 6 of the data to simplify results.
</p><p>The data shows the relation of pressure and temperature, and the relationship between two quantities is best shown as a graph. Options A,B and D will still just give a lot of numbers which a layperson would probably have a difficult time understanding. Option D especially is a big NO, because you shouldn't just remove data like that. More than simplifying the results, it would change the results.</p><p>
</p><p><strong>5. A. </strong>A filmmaker wants to depict a realistic dramatization of a scientist making and communicating an important scientific discovery. Which plot description would best depict the methods of discovery and communication that a modern professional scientist uses?
</p><p>A. The scientist collaborates with others to plan and carry out an experiment and then writes a paper that has a clear conclusion. He submits it to a professional journal for peer review, after which the results are presented apublicly.
</p><p>B. The scientist works with a few other scientists in a secret lab that is sponsored by a large business corporation. When the scientists have results, they contact others in the scientific community to report their results.
</p><p>C. The scientist works alone in a lab until he makes a dramatic breakthrough and then immediately announces the results through a worldwide press conference.
</p><p>D. The scientist seeks input and data from a wide range of people of different scientific backgrounds and then publishes all the data and results on the Internet so that all the collaborators can apply it to their individual research.
</p><p>Option A is the answer because it is the only one that mentions peer reviews before releasing results. This is an important part of scientists discoveries since the discovery must be double-checked first before announced. It would just cause confusion if a scientist announces a wrong discovery.</p><p>
</p><p><strong>6. C. </strong>  
Which best describes the reliability of the information?
</p><p>A. It is not reliable because only scientists can use scientific information for reference.
</p><p>B. It is not reliable because it doesn’t talk about how to test and only gives data about the breeds.
</p><p>C. It is reliable because the article is based on multiple studies done by scientists at multiple veterinary schools.
</p><p>D. It is reliable because it gives information about both types of Labradors in addition to information about other types of dogs.
</p><p>Options B and D talk more about the completeness of the information rather than the reliability. Option A is not true, since scientific information can be used by anyone as reference. Option C is true since having multiple sources confirm the same thing makes it more reliable than just a single source. This is connected to the importance of peer reviews in number 5.</p><br /><p>Some additional sources:</p><p>Example on conversion: https://brainly.ph/question/86333</p><p>Data presentation: https://brainly.ph/question/1577588</p><p>Laboratory Equipment: https://brainly.ph/question/627413</p><p>Hope this helps!</p><br />

Refer to the given illustration. How does sunlight affect the growth of a plant? In most plants, photosynthesis takes place mainly in the leaves. For photosynthesis to work, the chloroplast needs a source of energy like sunlight and ingredients such as carbon dioxide and water. When light energy, carbon dioxide, and water are present, a chemical reaction takes place. Two different set-ups were prepared, Plant A and Plant B. Plant A was placed inside the box, hence, there is no air and sunlight. Plant B was placed outside the house with enough sunlight. After a week, the effect of sunlight on the growth and development of the plants was observed. Plant A, which is placed inside the box withered and died. While plant B with enough sunlight grew healthy. Therefore, it only proves that sunlight and a gas in the air has a great effect on the growth of a plant.

The question should be <strong>specific</strong> and <strong>can be answered through an experiment</strong>. After identifying the problem, one should <strong>gather pertinent data about the problem in order to come up with a tentative answer to the question</strong>. This tentative answer is known as the <strong>hypothesis</strong>. To prove or disprove the hypothesis, one has to <strong>conduct an experiment</strong>. The experiment will allow us to see the relationship between the independent and dependent variables. In the situation given, we are trying to see the effect of sunlight on the growth of the plant. <strong>Results of the experiment are then gathered and analyzed.</strong> The analysis of results will either accept or reject the hypothesis. After the analysis of data, a conclusion is made. The <strong>conclusion</strong> is the answer to the question or problem. Also, the conclusion may lead us to more questions and problems, and the cycle repeats. </p><p></p><p>#BRAINLYFAST</p><p></p><br />

The conclusion is the answer to our question/problem and this conclusion can be another venue for more inquiries and discoveries.
