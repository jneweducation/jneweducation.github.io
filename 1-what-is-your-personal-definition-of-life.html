Did you have enough money to pay your electric bills before the cut-off date? How are you affected by these situations? In this module, you will know that there are different stages of stress that you experience in your everyday life. It is important to remember that stress is not a definition of 'one size fits all'. Depending on the way you view the stressor, what stresses one person out might not bother you at all. This is why the causes and consequences of stress are important to consider, as well as how to recognize your own stressors and how to handle your stress properly. Stress is defined as a physiological and emotional responses to significant or unexpected change one's life (Payne, et al., 2005). It may also refer to what you feel when you react to pressure from the outside world or from yourself. Activity 3. Remember Me! There are two kinds of stress: eustress and distress. Eustress refers to positive and healthy response of the body from the stressor On the other hand, distress refers to a negative reaction of the body towards a given stressor. Directions: Identify the following situations as to eustress and distress, Draw if it is eustress and if distress, 1. Going to the beach 2. Getting a low grade 3. Arguing with your friend 4.

4. There are different degrees of friendship. Some friends are casual; you may share a couple of interests with them, and you may talk sometimes, but you're not as deep as you could be, and that's just how the friendship is. Other friends you're more close to. You spend time whenever you can, and you've been through it all. You may have had a childhood with them and have experienced ups and downs, and yet they're still good friends of yours. The two of you can go for a long time without talking, but once you start talking again, it's like no time has passed. The relationship just feels secure. Then there is the social media definition of a friend, in which the two of you have your accounts linked together on social media, but maybe you don't actually talk at all. You should not confuse social media 'friends' with real-life friends.

5. What is the difference between a friend and an acquaintance? An acquaintance is a person who you talk to on occasion, but the friendship bond is just not there. Maybe it would be there if the two of you talked more, but odds are, the person is someone who is nice and good to talk to on occasion, but it just doesn’t feel as though there’s a bond. They likely won't be the person you talk to when problems are happening. They aren't going to be the person you see yourself spending a lot of time with. Alternatively, some friendships blossom from acquaintanceships, if we only give them a chance. Look at your social media, as well as the people you know in real life. How many of them would you say are friends? How many are just acquaintances? Perhaps the biggest problem with friendship today is mixing the two up. Odds are, only a handful of people in your life are worthy to be your friend, while the others are actually acquaintances.

                                            Activity 56: The Philippines’ Anti-Terrorism Act of 2020: Below explains what the bill exactly says and does:
   The Philippines' Anti-Terrorism Act of 2020
The Anti-Terrorism Act of 2020 amends the Human Security Act of 2007. It expands the definition of terrorism to include acts intended to cause "death or serious bodily injury to any person," "extensive damage and destruction" to a government facility, private property or critical infrastructure and when the purpose of those acts is to "intimidate [the] general public," "create an atmosphere or message of fear," or "seriously destabilize or destroy the fundamental political, economic and social structures of the country." Those found guilty face life sentences without the chance of parole.
The act also criminalizes the "threat, planning, training, facilitating of" and "proposal" and "inciting" to terrorist activities by means of speeches, proclamations, writings, banners and emblems. It also subjects suspects to surveillance, warrantless arrest and detention for up to 24 days. In addition, it removes compensation for the suspect in the event of acquittal and boosts the Anti-Terrorism Council, the implementer of the law, whose members are appointed by the president.

   Meanwhile, the Philippines' Commission on Human Rights said the broad definition of "terrorism" in the bill "paves the road for possible abuse."
"By this broad definition, starting a fight in a bar could technically be classified as an act of terrorism," said Human Rights Watch, which called the act "a human rights disaster in the making."

It may also refer to what you feel when you react to pressure from the outside world or from yourself. Activity 3. Remember Me! There are two kinds of stress: eustress and distress. Eustress refers to positive and healthy response of the body from the stressor On the other hand, distress refers to a negative reaction of the body towards a given stressor.

Attending a birthday party 5. Watching your favorite movie 6. Losing your money 7. Having a new shoe 8. You passed your periodical exam 9. You are left by the school bus 10.

4. There are different degrees of friendship. Some friends are casual; you may share a couple of interests with them, and you may talk sometimes, but you're not as deep as you could be, and that's just how the friendship is. Other friends you're more close to. You spend time whenever you can, and you've been through it all. You may have had a childhood with them and have experienced ups and downs, and yet they're still good friends of yours. The two of you can go for a long time without talking, but once you start talking again, it's like no time has passed. The relationship just feels secure. Then there is the social media definition of a friend, in which the two of you have your accounts linked together on social media, but maybe you don't actually talk at all. You should not confuse social media 'friends' with real-life friends.

5. What is the difference between a friend and an acquaintance? An acquaintance is a person who you talk to on occasion, but the friendship bond is just not there. Maybe it would be there if the two of you talked more, but odds are, the person is someone who is nice and good to talk to on occasion, but it just doesn’t feel as though there’s a bond. They likely won't be the person you talk to when problems are happening. They aren't going to be the person you see yourself spending a lot of time with. Alternatively, some friendships blossom from acquaintanceships, if we only give them a chance. Look at your social media, as well as the people you know in real life. How many of them would you say are friends? How many are just acquaintances? Perhaps the biggest problem with friendship today is mixing the two up. Odds are, only a handful of people in your life are worthy to be your friend, while the others are actually acquaintances.

                            28. Activity 56: The Philippines’ Anti-Terrorism Act of 2020: Below explains what the bill exactly says and does:
   The Philippines' Anti-Terrorism Act of 2020
The Anti-Terrorism Act of 2020 amends the Human Security Act of 2007. It expands the definition of terrorism to include acts intended to cause "death or serious bodily injury to any person," "extensive damage and destruction" to a government facility, private property or critical infrastructure and when the purpose of those acts is to "intimidate [the] general public," "create an atmosphere or message of fear," or "seriously destabilize or destroy the fundamental political, economic and social structures of the country." Those found guilty face life sentences without the chance of parole.
The act also criminalizes the "threat, planning, training, facilitating of" and "proposal" and "inciting" to terrorist activities by means of speeches, proclamations, writings, banners and emblems. It also subjects suspects to surveillance, warrantless arrest and detention for up to 24 days. In addition, it removes compensation for the suspect in the event of acquittal and boosts the Anti-Terrorism Council, the implementer of the law, whose members are appointed by the president.

   Meanwhile, the Philippines' Commission on Human Rights said the broad definition of "terrorism" in the bill "paves the road for possible abuse."
"By this broad definition, starting a fight in a bar could technically be classified as an act of terrorism," said Human Rights Watch, which called the act "a human rights disaster in the making."

                        Work can be defined as an activity that involves physical or mental effort to accomplish a task or goal. It may be paid or unpaid, and it could range from manual labor to professional services. Work can be seen as a fundamental aspect of human life, as it enables individuals to achieve their goals and provide for their needs and wants.Valuing one's own work is important because it fosters a sense of self-worth, dignity, and purpose. It allows a person to take pride in their accomplishments and to recognize the effort and time that they have invested in their work. When one values their own work, they are motivated to improve their skills, increase their productivity, and strive for excellence.Developing desirable work habits or values is crucial to achieving success and personal fulfillment. Some of these habits include punctuality, reliability, dedication, initiative, and accountability. Punctuality means showing up on time and respecting other people's time. Reliability involves keeping promises and meeting deadlines. Dedication means being committed to one's work and giving it the necessary time and effort. Initiative involves being proactive and taking the lead when necessary. Accountability involves taking responsibility for one's actions and decisions.Time management refers to the process of planning, organizing, and controlling one's time to achieve maximum productivity and efficiency. It involves prioritizing tasks, setting goals, and allocating time effectively to accomplish them. Effective time management enables individuals to accomplish more in less time and to reduce stress and anxiety caused by a lack of time.Time is a crucial resource that is directly related to productivity. Effective time management allows individuals to prioritize tasks and allocate time efficiently, which results in increased productivity. When time is managed well, individuals can accomplish more in less time and reduce the risk of burnout and stress caused by overwork.Some instances where one can save time and energy at home include creating a cleaning schedule, preparing meals in advance, organizing household items, and automating tasks such as bill payments and laundry.Project-making is important in daily life because it helps individuals to accomplish their goals and achieve their desired outcomes. Projects provide a structured approach to achieving complex tasks and enable individuals to break them down into manageable steps. By completing projects, individuals can gain a sense of achievement and personal satisfaction.Setting objectives before beginning a project is important because it provides a clear direction and purpose for the project. Objectives help individuals to focus their efforts and prioritize their tasks, which reduces the risk of wasted time and resources. Objectives also enable individuals to measure their progress and evaluate their success in achieving their goals.<p></p><p>brainliest pls ^^ ty</p><br />
