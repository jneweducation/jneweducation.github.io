I was sitting in the class, surrounded by people taking notes and paying attention to how to do equations, which would have been okay if I was supposed to be in an algebra class. In reality, I was supposed to be in geometry, and when I discovered my error, I had already missed the first twenty minutes of a one-hour said, "You're late* That would have been bad enough, but in my next class my history teacher spoke so class When I got to the correct class, all twenty-five students turned and looked at me as the teacher fast I could not follow most of what they said. The only thing I did hear was that we were having a quiz tomorrow over today's lecture. My day seemed to be going better during botany class, that is, until we visited the lab. I had a sneezing fit because of one of the plants in the lab and had to leave the room When I finally finished my classes for the day, I discovered I had locked my keys in the car and had to wait for my brother to bring another set. My first day of school was so bad that I know the rest will have to be better.

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>These are words that tell me I’m making a difference for my students. I’ve been lucky enough to teach physical education for 37 years in Manitoba, and in that time I’ve seen remarkable growth and change in a subject that was once hated and loved by students in equal measure.</p><p>Speak to someone who took physical education in the 1970s or 1980s and you are just as likely to hear them say it was a terrible, humiliating experience as you are to hear how empowering and fun it was.</p><p>Many of today’s parents have memories of a sport model curriculum which allowed those who had strong fitness and movement skills to shine and those who didn’t to hope they wouldn’t be noticed. Fitness tests gauged your performance against a set standard and you either measured up or failed. There was little allowance for individual differences; it was a one-size fits all approach with a single measure of success.</p><p></p><br />
