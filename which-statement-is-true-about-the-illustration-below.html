                        QUANTITATIVE RESEARCH
<p><strong>Quantitative research</strong> is one of the main types of research, together with qualitative research. <strong>Quantitative research</strong> is focused on the data gathered, transforming and presenting them into graphs and charts. <strong>Quantitative research</strong> is scientific and statistical. <strong>Quantitative research</strong> is classified into categories: descriptive, correlational, ex post facto, quasi-experimental, and experimental.
</p><p>
</p><p>Here are some facts involving quantitative research.
</p><strong>B</strong>. Quantitative study does not deliver in-depth understanding of the problem or study.
<strong>C</strong>. The control group does not receive intervention.
<strong>A</strong>. An example of a research question with quantitative methods is “What is the most popular social media platform used by Senior High School students?”
<strong>A</strong>. The limited participant’s responses to the given questions is what poses as a weakness of quantitative research.
<strong>B</strong>. Being less expensive is not a strength of quantitative research.
<strong>C</strong>. “The determination of the degree of satisfaction of various sectors on the online and modular blended learning” is a descriptive research topic.
<strong>A</strong>. An example of a correlational research topic is “The effects of non-renewal of the ABS-CBN franchise to the average television viewing time of housewives”.
<strong>A</strong>. A correlational research looks at the relationship of one characteristic to another.
<strong>D</strong>. Quantitative research does not help understand the perception of satisfaction of domestic violence victims.
<strong>B</strong>. It is sometimes true that nominal variable is expressed in numbers.
<strong>C</strong>. The independent and dependent variables are never applicable to all quantitative studies.
<strong>B</strong>. Dependent variables can sometimes be manipulated.
<strong>A</strong>. The student’s feelings towards the cat and dog is extraneous variable to the quantitative research.
<strong>C</strong>. The number of views per uploaded video can be considered as a dependent variable.
<strong>C</strong>. The student’s height can be seen as a continuous variable.
