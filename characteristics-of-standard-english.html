The roles of English within and between many of the countries which make up Asia are increasing,
and English is constantly being used and negotiated as a mutual means of communication by Asian
multilinguals for whom English is an additional language. It is timely, therefore, to consider ways in which
these Englishes have been developing, along with the roles English is currently playing. Areas worthy of
investigation include the influence of language contact and the motivations for the presence of non-standard
forms in these new varieties of English. Given the research reviewed in this paper, the criteria by which the
use of non-standard forms is classified as characteristic of the particular variety need to be revised.

The roles of English within and between the many of the countries which make up Southeast Asia are increasing, and English is constantly being used and negotiated as a mutual means of communication by Asian multilinguals for whom English is an additional language. It is timely, therefore, to consider ways in which these Englishes have been developing, along with the roles English is currently playing. Areas worthy of investigation include the influence of language contact and the motivations for the presence of non‐standard forms in these new varieties of English. Given the recent research reviewed in this paper, the criteria by which the use of non‐standard forms are classified as characteristic of the particular variety need to be revised. The paper will conclude by considering whether the role of English as a lingua franca in the region has reached its zenith and whether regional language education policy is likely allow the languages of Asia to thrive.

Your song!Direction: Read the statements below and compose a song which the lyrics are literally, discussing what you understand."The actualization of human being in all his/her learning is what we called culture. This idea is the overall concept about the new topic. As the lesson presented, it will give you the meaning of culture like the following:1. Culture refers to a group or community which shares common experiences that shape the way its members understand the world. It includes groups that we are born into, such as race, national origin,16gender, class, or religion. It can also include a group we join orbecome part of.2. Culture is a strong part of people's lives. It influences their views, values, humor, hopes, loyalties, worries and fears. It helps to have some perspective and understanding of their cultures.3. Culture and society defined, culture consists of the beliefs, behaviors,objects, and other characteristics common to the members of aparticular group or society.4. Through culture, people and groups define themselves, conform tosociety's shared values, and contribute to society.5. The major elements of culture are symbols, language, norms, values,and artifacts.a. A symbol is anything that is used to stand for something else. People who share a culture often attach a specific meaning to an object, gesture, sound, or image. For example, a cross is a significant symbol to Christians. It is not simply two pieces of wood attached to each other, nor is it just an old object of torture and execution. To Christians, it represents the basis of their entire religion, and they have great reverence for the symbol.b. Language is a system of words and symbols used to communicate with other people. This includes full languages as we usually think of them, such as English, Spanish, French, etc. but, it also includes body language, slang, and common phrases that are unique to certain groups of people.C. Systems of values are culturally defined standards for what is good or desirable. Members of the culture use the shared system of values to decide what is good and what is bad."​</a>

and English is constantly being used and negotiated as a mutual means of communication by Asian
multilinguals for whom English is an additional language. It is timely, therefore, to consider ways in which
these Englishes have been developing, along with the roles English is currently playing. Areas worthy of
investigation include the influence of language contact and the motivations for the presence of non-standard

use of non-standard forms is classified as characteristic of the particular variety need to be revised.

Culture refers to a group or community which shares common experiences that shape the way its members understand the world. It includes groups that we are born into, such as race, national origin,16gender, class, or religion. It can also include a group we join orbecome part of.2. Culture is a strong part of people's lives. It influences their views, values, humor, hopes, loyalties, worries and fears. It helps to have some perspective and understanding of their cultures.3. Culture and society defined, culture consists of the beliefs, behaviors,objects, and other characteristics common to the members of aparticular group or society.4. Through culture, people and groups define themselves, conform tosociety's shared values, and contribute to society.5. The major elements of culture are symbols, language, norms, values,and artifacts.a. A symbol is anything that is used to stand for something else. People who share a culture often attach a specific meaning to an object, gesture, sound, or image. For example, a cross is a significant symbol to Christians. It is not simply two pieces of wood attached to each other, nor is it just an old object of torture and execution. To Christians, it represents the basis of their entire religion, and they have great reverence for the symbol.b. Language is a system of words and symbols used to communicate with other people. This includes full languages as we usually think of them, such as English, Spanish, French, etc. but, it also includes body language, slang, and common phrases that are unique to certain groups of people.C. Systems of values are culturally defined standards for what is good or desirable. Members of the culture use the shared system of values to decide what is good and what is bad."​</h2><br />
