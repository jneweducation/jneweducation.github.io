                                            I. Direction: Answer the following question based on the principles of separation of powers and check and balances.Article Duterte to appoint 5 more SC justices in 2019- Edu Punay (Philippine Star)With the latest appointment of Associate Justice Henri Jean-Paul Inting, the high court currently has seven appointees of Duterte among its 15 members.The other six are Associate Justices Andres Reyes Jr., Alexander Gesmundo, Jose Reyes Jr., Ramon Paul Hernando, Rosmari Carandang and Amy Lazaro-Javier. But later this year, the President is expected to appoint five more magistrates in the SC due to the retirement of both Chief Justice Lucas Bersamin and Senior Associate Justice Antonio Carpio in October and Associate Justices Mariano del Castillo and Francis Jardeleza in July and September, respectively. There is also an expected vacancy once Bersamin’s replacement from the high court is appointed. By that time, there will be a total of 12 Duterte-appointed justices – a clear majority – sitting in the high tribunal that will decide on crucial cases involving the administration, including the Chico River and Kaliwa Dam loan projects with China. The SC, sitting as Presidential Electoral Tribunal, is also expected to act on the election protest of former senator Ferdinand Marcos Jr. against Vice President Leni Robredo from their 2016 vice presidential face-off. Duterte has actually appointed nine associate justices in the SC so far, but two of them are no longer with the Court. Samuel Martires was appointed ombudsman in July last year while Noel Tijam retired from the judiciary last January.Question:Based on what you have learned on the principles of separation of powers and check and balances, will there be a deterioration of equilibrium among the branches of government given the majority of the SC are Duterte appointees? Why or why not? (20 pts)Article 2Office of the President’s P8.2 B 2020 budget gets swift House OK- By: Pathricia Ann V. Roxas - ReporterSource: (https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/1161623/office-of-the-presidents-p8-2-b-2020-budget-gets-swift-house-ok)MANILA, Philippines – Citing “traditional courtesy,” the House of Representatives’ Appropriations Committee approved the P8.2 billion proposed 2020 budget of the Office of the President (OP) in less than six minutes.Panel chairman and Davao City 3rd District Rep. Isidro Ungab cited traditional courtesy given to co-equal branches of the government when it comes to budget deliberations in swiftly approving the appropriations for President Rodrigo Duterte’s office.He said the same courtesy was accorded to the Office of the Vice President, the judiciary, and constitutional commissions.Although the approval faced no objection, Albay 1st District Rep. Edcel Lagman and Bayan Muna party-list Rep. Ferdinand Gaite manifested that they would scrutinize the OP’s budget during the plenary deliberations.Under the OP’s proposed budget for next year, some P4.5 billion was earmarked for confidential and intelligence expenses, which several Duterte administration critics had questioned. Bayan Muna Rep. Carlos Zarate linked this to a possible nationwide martial law when seen in the context of the P388 billion “war budget” of the administration.The opposition lawmaker said these funds “would be of better use” if allocated for programs “addressing the social ills that incite armed conflict” such as free land distribution, a living wage and national industrialization.The OP’s budget jumped by 21 percent compared to its 2019 budget of P6.8 billion.81 percent or P6.7 billion of the OP’s 2020 budget was earmarked for operations, specifically its presidential oversight, advisory, legal and legislative services, and executive staff services programs.The rest would go to the general administration and support for the office which includes retirement and life insurance premium and pension.The total national budget proposed for 2020 is P4.1 trillion.QUESTIONThe Appropriations Committee approved the P8.2 billion proposed 2020 budget of the Office of the President (OP) in less than six minutes. In your own opinion, is this reasonable that there is not further investigation on the proposed budget of the office of the president? Why or why not? (20 points)​</a>

                            4. I. Direction: Answer the following question based on the principles of separation of powers and check and balances.Article Duterte to appoint 5 more SC justices in 2019- Edu Punay (Philippine Star)With the latest appointment of Associate Justice Henri Jean-Paul Inting, the high court currently has seven appointees of Duterte among its 15 members.The other six are Associate Justices Andres Reyes Jr., Alexander Gesmundo, Jose Reyes Jr., Ramon Paul Hernando, Rosmari Carandang and Amy Lazaro-Javier. But later this year, the President is expected to appoint five more magistrates in the SC due to the retirement of both Chief Justice Lucas Bersamin and Senior Associate Justice Antonio Carpio in October and Associate Justices Mariano del Castillo and Francis Jardeleza in July and September, respectively. There is also an expected vacancy once Bersamin’s replacement from the high court is appointed. By that time, there will be a total of 12 Duterte-appointed justices – a clear majority – sitting in the high tribunal that will decide on crucial cases involving the administration, including the Chico River and Kaliwa Dam loan projects with China. The SC, sitting as Presidential Electoral Tribunal, is also expected to act on the election protest of former senator Ferdinand Marcos Jr. against Vice President Leni Robredo from their 2016 vice presidential face-off. Duterte has actually appointed nine associate justices in the SC so far, but two of them are no longer with the Court. Samuel Martires was appointed ombudsman in July last year while Noel Tijam retired from the judiciary last January.Question:Based on what you have learned on the principles of separation of powers and check and balances, will there be a deterioration of equilibrium among the branches of government given the majority of the SC are Duterte appointees? Why or why not? (20 pts)Article 2Office of the President’s P8.2 B 2020 budget gets swift House OK- By: Pathricia Ann V. Roxas - ReporterSource: (https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/1161623/office-of-the-presidents-p8-2-b-2020-budget-gets-swift-house-ok)MANILA, Philippines – Citing “traditional courtesy,” the House of Representatives’ Appropriations Committee approved the P8.2 billion proposed 2020 budget of the Office of the President (OP) in less than six minutes.Panel chairman and Davao City 3rd District Rep. Isidro Ungab cited traditional courtesy given to co-equal branches of the government when it comes to budget deliberations in swiftly approving the appropriations for President Rodrigo Duterte’s office.He said the same courtesy was accorded to the Office of the Vice President, the judiciary, and constitutional commissions.Although the approval faced no objection, Albay 1st District Rep. Edcel Lagman and Bayan Muna party-list Rep. Ferdinand Gaite manifested that they would scrutinize the OP’s budget during the plenary deliberations.Under the OP’s proposed budget for next year, some P4.5 billion was earmarked for confidential and intelligence expenses, which several Duterte administration critics had questioned. Bayan Muna Rep. Carlos Zarate linked this to a possible nationwide martial law when seen in the context of the P388 billion “war budget” of the administration.The opposition lawmaker said these funds “would be of better use” if allocated for programs “addressing the social ills that incite armed conflict” such as free land distribution, a living wage and national industrialization.The OP’s budget jumped by 21 percent compared to its 2019 budget of P6.8 billion.81 percent or P6.7 billion of the OP’s 2020 budget was earmarked for operations, specifically its presidential oversight, advisory, legal and legislative services, and executive staff services programs.The rest would go to the general administration and support for the office which includes retirement and life insurance premium and pension.The total national budget proposed for 2020 is P4.1 trillion.QUESTIONThe Appropriations Committee approved the P8.2 billion proposed 2020 budget of the Office of the President (OP) in less than six minutes. In your own opinion, is this reasonable that there is not further investigation on the proposed budget of the office of the president? Why or why not? (20 points)​</h2><br />
