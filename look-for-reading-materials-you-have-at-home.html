A letterbox overflowing with advertisements is a sure sign to house breakers that nobody's home.

These materials have their own property or characteristics. wooden cabinet can't be bent because it's very tough but they can easi be shaped. Unlike the wood cabinet, crayons and pencils are brittle. Th metal key is tough, hard and has luster. A tin can shaped into penc This means that metals are malleable, that which can be han mered into thin sheets. This property is called malleability. In car mar ufacturing companies, bending of iron and steel bars are done in makin the parts of the bicycle or other automobiles, and appliances found home. Isn't that amazing? case. Metals are usually shiny, and can conduct both heat and electricit You probably observed electric wires at home. The materials used for th are copper wires.

                                            please answer this..title - ChangesBy Rachael C CastroWhen I was younger. I could still hear my father play music using theturntable And as the time goes by, nobody under eighteen years old wouldask about, well those next to it like tape recorders, compact disk or CD.Your expressions date you. For example. I am from the group before Martial Law, the time when Filipino pop music was very popular!My father's music pushed me to collect some old-fashioned terms. Telephones now became handy and called cell phones, iceboxes then became refrigerators, now are food-storage systems, the audio system then now a home entertainment center About food, macaroni, noodles, and spaghetti are terms used by the oldies. These are now called pasta.Back then, a camera needed rolls of film for snapshots, while now you can have as many poses as you want plus your selfie. Buy your film in a shopping center now called the mall and have your picture developed by a printing machine which now can be just inside your home beside your laptop a printerPeers instead of pals and role models for heroes. Detention centers for jails and wetland is used to be ecologically correct swamp. Siblings for brothers and sisters, parameters for boundaries, finances for money.Well maybe this is as it should be: marking the time or era or generation with words. I just can't imagine how a divan looks like when one of the supervisors told us to have one inside the room for our cleaning materials. I should have understood it only if she said sofa.Read a short story and answer the following questions; 1. What type of connection is used in the story you have read? 2.

                            17. You have read in the story the different solid materials found home. These materials have their own property or characteristics. wooden cabinet can't be bent because it's very tough but they can easi be shaped. Unlike the wood cabinet, crayons and pencils are brittle. Th metal key is tough, hard and has luster. A tin can shaped into penc This means that metals are malleable, that which can be han mered into thin sheets. This property is called malleability. In car mar ufacturing companies, bending of iron and steel bars are done in makin the parts of the bicycle or other automobiles, and appliances found home. Isn't that amazing? case. Metals are usually shiny, and can conduct both heat and electricit You probably observed electric wires at home. The materials used for th are copper wires. When bent and hammered into thin wires, they w change in size and shape only, but there's no new material forme Ductility is associated with the ability of the materials to be hammere thin or stretched into wire without breaking. A ductile substance can drawn into Other examples of ductile materials include gold, and copper. Other solid materials can be bent like pencil, crayons, an small twigs. They are brittle. Look at the pictures below. These are materials that have bee shaped or made into another material. Can you name each materi found in Figure 2.

Contemporary construction of tall buildings from timber, in whole or in part, suggests a growing interest in the potential for building with wood at a scale not previously attainable. As wood is the only significant building material that is grown, we have a natural inclination that building in wood is good for the environment. But under what conditions is this really the case? The environmental benefits of using timber are not straightforward; although it is a natural product, a large amount of energy is used to dry and process it. Much of this can come from the biomass of the tree itself, but that requires investment in plant, which is not always possible in an industry that is widely distributed among many small producers. And what should we build with wood? Are skyscrapers in timber a good use of this natural resource, or are there other aspects of civil and structural engineering, or large-scale infrastructure, that would be a better use of wood? Here, we consider a holistic picture ranging in scale from the science of the cell wall to the engineering and global policies that could maximise forestry and timber construction as a boon to both people and the planet.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>[tex]\huge\star{\underline{\mathtt{\red{ho}\pink{pe}\green{its}\blue{he} \purple{l} \orange{p}\pink᭄ }}} \ \\  \\ </p><p> \red{fo} \orange{ll} \blue{ow} \ \:  \pink{for} \:  \green{mo} \orange{re}[/tex]</p><p></p><br />

For example. I am from the group before Martial Law, the time when Filipino pop music was very popular!My father's music pushed me to collect some old-fashioned terms. Telephones now became handy and called cell phones, iceboxes then became refrigerators, now are food-storage systems, the audio system then now a home entertainment center About food, macaroni, noodles, and spaghetti are terms used by the oldies. These are now called pasta.Back then, a camera needed rolls of film for snapshots, while now you can have as many poses as you want plus your selfie. Buy your film in a shopping center now called the mall and have your picture developed by a printing machine which now can be just inside your home beside your laptop a printerPeers instead of pals and role models for heroes. Detention centers for jails and wetland is used to be ecologically correct swamp. Siblings for brothers and sisters, parameters for boundaries, finances for money.Well maybe this is as it should be: marking the time or era or generation with words. I just can't imagine how a divan looks like when one of the supervisors told us to have one inside the room for our cleaning materials. I should have understood it only if she said sofa.Read a short story and answer the following questions; 1. What type of connection is used in the story you have read? 2.
