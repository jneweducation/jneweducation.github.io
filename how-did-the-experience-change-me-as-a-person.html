                                            21. Americans can be divided into three groups—smokers, nonsmokers and that expanding pack of us who have quit. Those who have never smoked don't know what they're missing, but former smokers, ex-smokers, reformed smokers can never forget. We are veterans of a personal war, linked by that watershed experience of ceasing to smoke and by the temptation to have just one more cigarette. *

26. The Philippines experiences an average of 20 typhoons a year. Being surrounded by bodies of water makes us prone to experience some weather disturbances. The biggest contributor of the weather disturbances in our country is the Pacific Ocean which lies on the eastern side of our country. The vast and warm waters of the ocean can generate many weather disturbances. *

27. When the cold air sinks, it results to a high-pressure area. Since most of the air is pressing down, the air on the surface becomes dry. Formation of a high pressure area indicates fair weather; fewer clouds are found on the sky. As the air continuously rises, it will eventually cool, condense and form clouds. The formation of a low-pressure area indicates the possibility of rain. There is a higher chance of rain when more clouds are formed. An LPA can result to weather disturbances. Rains and strong winds are brought about by low pressure system *

28. Weather disturbances are devastating. They can cause damage to our life and properties. Heavy winds can destroy power and communication lines. Roads and bridges are also damaged due to heavy rainfall and flooding. Weather disturbances can also destroy our means of livelihood. Heavy rain and strong winds can uproot trees and destroy crops that provide us with food. Therefore, there is always food shortage when there is a typhoon. (Source: Science Beyond Borders) *

29. Most animal extinctions are brought about by people. As population increased, people needed more food, more shelters, and more comforts. Forest lands had to give way to agriculture. More trees had to be cut down for housing and furniture. As their natural habitat diminished, so did the population of the tamaraws, eagles and other animals. *

Yesterday, unlike my typical quarantine routine, I woke up early. The moment my alarm went off at 8:00am, I jumped out of bed and rushed to the bathroom to shower. Fifteen minutes was all it took for me to bath and dress. I was ready to go. My heart couldn't keep the excitement and joy. Finally, we were allowed to go out. 2 Once upon a time, the world lived as if there was no pause nor end. It was all hustle, grind, and run until everyone was breathless and exhausted from all the work they had to do. Then, life changed when the virus spread. People couldn't go out of their homes. Work and school stopped. Time seemingly slowed like never before. 3 Alcohol-based hand rubs reduce the growth of microorganisms by dissolving the bacteria's cellular membrane. 4 Dr. Mary Grace Dacuma of the UP Pandemic Response Team has released findings from a recent study on how an epidemic happens and what an epidemic wave is. She noted that the COVID-19 epidemic in the Philippines most likely started with an imported case from an infected person or persons who entered the Philippines. The infected person with the virus is likely the index case that spread the virus to others locally. Dacuma pointed out that the index case(s), especially those that did not cause local transmission, does not form part of the epidemic wave. (Manila Bulletin 2020) 5. This virus does not have a nationality, it does not have an agenda or a political affiliation, it exists to spread where, when and how it can. The only thing that can stop it is community and cooperation. This is not a time for blame or division... The future is being written today, let's write it together with all of our hearts and our humanity. (Morgan, J. &amp; Rosemberg, A. 2020)​</a>

                                            What can I use as a title for this?
Back in the old days, being alone was fun because no one was going to bother you and you can do whatever you want. Also, you can focus on your studies but when I grew up, it changed me from being alone. I knew that it is dangerous because it is addicting once you see how peaceful it is like you do not want to deal with other people anymore. 
I want to elaborate on my statement that being alone is dangerous and addictive because based on my experience when I was the only child before my parents do not allow me to play outside they just let me play around the house, study, and sleep that’s all I do every day. So when I was in grade 1 my classmate was bullying me my teacher found out because I run towards her what she did was call our parent and let them know that his son was bullying me after that I sat inside the classroom alone I did what I did was reading books and dictionaries sometimes I also sat outside in a little house which we call the reading area. I hate talking to everyone when I started to experience bullying it’s not just that happens there’s a lot more reason why I do not want to talk to them even to my family and classmates but I like to talk with my cousins. I knew that when you have those experiences from being alone it’s so hard to give trust and get close to them that is why it is dangerous and addictive to be alone because all the people surround you have so many things to say and judge you even though I want to feel happy but I just want to avoid it but until I graduated from grade school I thought I’m not going to get bully again it happens many times that is why I just want to be alone forever.
When I started going to high school I observe all my classmates and I think they’re not like the people I met before grade school feels that I want to have friends now and get to know them so I give my trust to them and I started to like to be with my friends everywhere we go and do nothing to their house just having a food trip and karaoke. It is also started for becoming a rebel we are sometimes do not go to school we went to our friend’s house or go somewhere else and get drunk like if you get drunk I feel I’m the happiest person it makes me forget everything my problem, and for being alone because I have my friends but whenever I’m with them it’s like your being rebellious because you’re not listening to your family anymore it’s like you have your own world and alone again. My friends now are gone I have only one friend now which is not like my friends before she is giving me good advice and she made me realize what is better for me to do. Now I’m overthinking too much because I realize that all I do is regret all my past decisions. The fact that you are not living your life fully enough and for addicting, you cannot control or stop yourself from being alone and scared to be alone you are still going to find another way to not be alone if I did not control it maybe because it will become your habit.
To sum up, don’t be alone for a long time do not be scared to give trust and hang out with people around you because not all the people that you will get to know will not going to bully, a bad influence sometimes they’re people that will motivate you, cheer you up, accept you from who you are and loved you in deep. You should socialize explore everything try out new things, get out of your comfort zone, give your trust, and share your feelings or thoughts with your cousins because you can trust them so you will not be alone anymore.</a>

                                            alin din ang introduction Instruction: Watch the movie 200 Pounds Beauty (2006) Afterwards, answer the following questions: 1. Describe the physical self of the main character (1) at the beginning of the movie, and at the of the movie. The main character Kang Han-na is an extremely overweight woman that is a ghost singer for a popular singer and a phone sex operator. She has a wonderful voice but not attractive enough to be considered. The main character physical appearance changed because she did a plastic surgery that is most of korean's ways to improve their self confidence and to be considered as a person. Han na did a head to toe plastic surgery, her eyes were steady to attractive eyes, nose from a huge to pointed one, lips were not different much, but her face totally changed her facial shape from rounded to oval. The body changed a lot because it really is the main reason of everyone to lose their confidence, her body went from obese and plump to petite, a dainty gorgeous woman although she really was beautiful when she was her true self. 2. What is the climax of the story? How does this turning point appeal to you? The climax of the story is when the overweight woman emerges pretty and slender. The main character decided to use South Korea's tool to boost a confidence and to be "accepted" by people that is plastic surgery. She chose to make herself different from before for the sake of her "crush" or the man she wanted so badly and also to be recognize. This story appeal to me in various ways, one is when she was down because some of her so called friends literally shows no support or even made her feel down, I somehow experience that situation and it really is diminishing in self confidence. Also the climax affects me when she finally boost her confidence when everyone started to compliment and admire her beauty, myself somehow relate in that situation, I am the kind of person who doesn't like to be complimented all the time but once someone does it genuinely makes me happy which helps me to gain and improve my self image. ff. Based on the entire narrative and on the ending, what kind of beauty is prescribed or supported by the film? Explain your answer. In my opinion, the movie prescribes an exotic kind of beauty because it tackles the body composition and the facial features itself, It describes how one based on the physical appearance and not on the personality, most people nowadays are like this, they admire a person just by their looks which is totally normal and fine but it is more admirable when someone looks deeper into the person's character. The lesson I've learned from this movie is simply plastic surgery is a truely a choice but it is different on why you would do it is it because it helps yourself to be more confident and build up your self worth or because of social pressure. Loving who you truely are plays a big factor on accepting your flaws and once you did everything falls in to the right places.​</a>

                                            young people out there -- to believe that you can make a difference your wagon to something bigger than yourselves. Let me tell you, this generation coming up unselfish, altruistic, creative, patriotic - I've seen you in every corner of the country. You believe in a fair, and just, and inclusive America. You know that constant change has been America's hallmark; that it's not something to fear but something to embrace. You are willing to carry this hard work of democracy forward. You'll soon outnumber all of us, and I believe as a result the future is in good hands. My fellow Americans, it has been the honor of my life to serve you. I won't stop. In fact, I will be right there with you, as a citizen, for all my remaining days. But for now, whether you are young or whether you're young at heart, I do have one final ask of you as your President -- the same thing I asked when you took a chance on me eight years ago. I'm asking you to believe. Not in my ability to bring about change - but in yours. I am asking you to hold fast to that faith written into our founding documents; that idea whispered by slaves and abolitionists; that spirit sung by immigrants and homesteaders and those who marched for justice; that creed reaffirmed by those who planted flags from foreign battlefields to the surface of the moon; a creed at the core of every American whose story is not yet written: Yes, we can. Yes, we did. Yes, we can. Thank you. God bless you. May God continue to bless the United States of America.

Better pay, higher position - these did not even come to mind. I prayed for direction. No position in other companies was open and no job offer came. For a year, I tried to be patient. A time came when I was no longer sad. I had accepted my place and found joy in little things. No doubt I still wanted a new job, but there was faith and assurance that God would fulfill his purpose for me and his will would be done. Soon enough, I received not one but two job offers! Trough the whole year waiting experience, I found that I became stronger and learned more about Jesus and myself. Had this been the old me, I would have just been irritated and impatient and resigned. I would have been angry and negative. But in Jesus, the former things have come. "Anxious," "weak" come be turned to "trusting", "being patient." Just goes to show that the Lord really does change our attitude in life. Answer the following questions: 1.

Those who have never smoked don't know what they're missing, but former smokers, ex-smokers, reformed smokers can never forget. We are veterans of a personal war, linked by that watershed experience of ceasing to smoke and by the temptation to have just one more cigarette. *

27. When the cold air sinks, it results to a high-pressure area. Since most of the air is pressing down, the air on the surface becomes dry. Formation of a high pressure area indicates fair weather; fewer clouds are found on the sky. As the air continuously rises, it will eventually cool, condense and form clouds. The formation of a low-pressure area indicates the possibility of rain. There is a higher chance of rain when more clouds are formed. An LPA can result to weather disturbances. Rains and strong winds are brought about by low pressure system *

Yesterday, unlike my typical quarantine routine, I woke up early. The moment my alarm went off at 8:00am, I jumped out of bed and rushed to the bathroom to shower. Fifteen minutes was all it took for me to bath and dress. I was ready to go. My heart couldn't keep the excitement and joy. Finally, we were allowed to go out. 2 Once upon a time, the world lived as if there was no pause nor end. It was all hustle, grind, and run until everyone was breathless and exhausted from all the work they had to do. Then, life changed when the virus spread. People couldn't go out of their homes. Work and school stopped. Time seemingly slowed like never before. 3 Alcohol-based hand rubs reduce the growth of microorganisms by dissolving the bacteria's cellular membrane. 4 Dr. Mary Grace Dacuma of the UP Pandemic Response Team has released findings from a recent study on how an epidemic happens and what an epidemic wave is. She noted that the COVID-19 epidemic in the Philippines most likely started with an imported case from an infected person or persons who entered the Philippines. The infected person with the virus is likely the index case that spread the virus to others locally. Dacuma pointed out that the index case(s), especially those that did not cause local transmission, does not form part of the epidemic wave. (Manila Bulletin 2020) 5. This virus does not have a nationality, it does not have an agenda or a political affiliation, it exists to spread where, when and how it can. The only thing that can stop it is community and cooperation. This is not a time for blame or division...

                            11. What can I use as a title for this?
Back in the old days, being alone was fun because no one was going to bother you and you can do whatever you want. Also, you can focus on your studies but when I grew up, it changed me from being alone. I knew that it is dangerous because it is addicting once you see how peaceful it is like you do not want to deal with other people anymore. 
I want to elaborate on my statement that being alone is dangerous and addictive because based on my experience when I was the only child before my parents do not allow me to play outside they just let me play around the house, study, and sleep that’s all I do every day. So when I was in grade 1 my classmate was bullying me my teacher found out because I run towards her what she did was call our parent and let them know that his son was bullying me after that I sat inside the classroom alone I did what I did was reading books and dictionaries sometimes I also sat outside in a little house which we call the reading area. I hate talking to everyone when I started to experience bullying it’s not just that happens there’s a lot more reason why I do not want to talk to them even to my family and classmates but I like to talk with my cousins. I knew that when you have those experiences from being alone it’s so hard to give trust and get close to them that is why it is dangerous and addictive to be alone because all the people surround you have so many things to say and judge you even though I want to feel happy but I just want to avoid it but until I graduated from grade school I thought I’m not going to get bully again it happens many times that is why I just want to be alone forever.
When I started going to high school I observe all my classmates and I think they’re not like the people I met before grade school feels that I want to have friends now and get to know them so I give my trust to them and I started to like to be with my friends everywhere we go and do nothing to their house just having a food trip and karaoke. It is also started for becoming a rebel we are sometimes do not go to school we went to our friend’s house or go somewhere else and get drunk like if you get drunk I feel I’m the happiest person it makes me forget everything my problem, and for being alone because I have my friends but whenever I’m with them it’s like your being rebellious because you’re not listening to your family anymore it’s like you have your own world and alone again. My friends now are gone I have only one friend now which is not like my friends before she is giving me good advice and she made me realize what is better for me to do. Now I’m overthinking too much because I realize that all I do is regret all my past decisions. The fact that you are not living your life fully enough and for addicting, you cannot control or stop yourself from being alone and scared to be alone you are still going to find another way to not be alone if I did not control it maybe because it will become your habit.
To sum up, don’t be alone for a long time do not be scared to give trust and hang out with people around you because not all the people that you will get to know will not going to bully, a bad influence sometimes they’re people that will motivate you, cheer you up, accept you from who you are and loved you in deep. You should socialize explore everything try out new things, get out of your comfort zone, give your trust, and share your feelings or thoughts with your cousins because you can trust them so you will not be alone anymore.</h2><br />

                            12. alin din ang introduction Instruction: Watch the movie 200 Pounds Beauty (2006) Afterwards, answer the following questions: 1. Describe the physical self of the main character (1) at the beginning of the movie, and at the of the movie. The main character Kang Han-na is an extremely overweight woman that is a ghost singer for a popular singer and a phone sex operator. She has a wonderful voice but not attractive enough to be considered. The main character physical appearance changed because she did a plastic surgery that is most of korean's ways to improve their self confidence and to be considered as a person. Han na did a head to toe plastic surgery, her eyes were steady to attractive eyes, nose from a huge to pointed one, lips were not different much, but her face totally changed her facial shape from rounded to oval. The body changed a lot because it really is the main reason of everyone to lose their confidence, her body went from obese and plump to petite, a dainty gorgeous woman although she really was beautiful when she was her true self. 2. What is the climax of the story? How does this turning point appeal to you? The climax of the story is when the overweight woman emerges pretty and slender. The main character decided to use South Korea's tool to boost a confidence and to be "accepted" by people that is plastic surgery. She chose to make herself different from before for the sake of her "crush" or the man she wanted so badly and also to be recognize. This story appeal to me in various ways, one is when she was down because some of her so called friends literally shows no support or even made her feel down, I somehow experience that situation and it really is diminishing in self confidence. Also the climax affects me when she finally boost her confidence when everyone started to compliment and admire her beauty, myself somehow relate in that situation, I am the kind of person who doesn't like to be complimented all the time but once someone does it genuinely makes me happy which helps me to gain and improve my self image. ff. Based on the entire narrative and on the ending, what kind of beauty is prescribed or supported by the film? Explain your answer. In my opinion, the movie prescribes an exotic kind of beauty because it tackles the body composition and the facial features itself, It describes how one based on the physical appearance and not on the personality, most people nowadays are like this, they admire a person just by their looks which is totally normal and fine but it is more admirable when someone looks deeper into the person's character. The lesson I've learned from this movie is simply plastic surgery is a truely a choice but it is different on why you would do it is it because it helps yourself to be more confident and build up your self worth or because of social pressure. Loving who you truely are plays a big factor on accepting your flaws and once you did everything falls in to the right places.​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Thank you for the summary of the movie "200 Pounds Beauty". Based on the narrative and ending of the movie, the kind of beauty that is prescribed or supported by the film is physical beauty. The movie portrays physical beauty as a means of gaining acceptance and success in society, as the main character's transformation leads to her achieving her dreams and winning the affection of her crush. The movie also suggests that plastic surgery is a viable solution for individuals who are not considered physically attractive, as it can provide a way to change one's appearance and gain confidence. However, it is important to note that the movie does not promote or support the idea of using plastic surgery to conform to societal standards of beauty or to meet others' expectations. Instead, it emphasizes the importance of self-love and acceptance, and the need to focus on inner qualities rather than just physical appearance.</p><br />

Let me tell you, this generation coming up unselfish, altruistic, creative, patriotic - I've seen you in every corner of the country. You believe in a fair, and just, and inclusive America. You know that constant change has been America's hallmark; that it's not something to fear but something to embrace. You are willing to carry this hard work of democracy forward. You'll soon outnumber all of us, and I believe as a result the future is in good hands. My fellow Americans, it has been the honor of my life to serve you. I won't stop. In fact, I will be right there with you, as a citizen, for all my remaining days. But for now, whether you are young or whether you're young at heart, I do have one final ask of you as your President -- the same thing I asked when you took a chance on me eight years ago. I'm asking you to believe. Not in my ability to bring about change - but in yours. I am asking you to hold fast to that faith written into our founding documents; that idea whispered by slaves and abolitionists; that spirit sung by immigrants and homesteaders and those who marched for justice; that creed reaffirmed by those who planted flags from foreign battlefields to the surface of the moon; a creed at the core of every American whose story is not yet written: Yes, we can. Yes, we did. Yes, we can. Thank you. God bless you. May God continue to bless the United States of America.

                            16.                         A New Name I need a job change - the office was just too far which meant little or no time for rest, prayer, and so on. Better pay, higher position - these did not even come to mind. I prayed for direction. No position in other companies was open and no job offer came. For a year, I tried to be patient. A time came when I was no longer sad. I had accepted my place and found joy in little things. No doubt I still wanted a new job, but there was faith and assurance that God would fulfill his purpose for me and his will would be done. Soon enough, I received not one but two job offers! Trough the whole year waiting experience, I found that I became stronger and learned more about Jesus and myself. Had this been the old me, I would have just been irritated and impatient and resigned. I would have been angry and negative. But in Jesus, the former things have come. "Anxious," "weak" come be turned to "trusting", "being patient." Just goes to show that the Lord really does change our attitude in life. Answer the following questions: 1.

                        <p><strong>Reflection on the poem When I Was One-and-Twenty by Alfred Edward Housman.</strong></p><p></p>The <strong>theme</strong> portrayed by the poem is love or more precisely the result of love.Based on the text, the attitude of young people towards life is shown that they tend to give or do everything without thinking much so that they later regret it.The special <strong>advice</strong> given by a wise man to youth is not to give everything to others. We could give a lot of things, but there are things we should not give because if we give them to the wrong person we will regret it.No, the young man does not listen to the advice of the wise man because he is still young and still naive so he only does what he wants.Based on the text, I can conclude that wise people perceive life as something that must be lived carefully and not rashly because otherwise, we will suffer losses from the wrong things we do.The meaning of the idea of<strong> 'wisdom of elder' </strong>in the given poem is that elders can become wiser because they may have made many mistakes and experienced many difficulties which made them then understand many things and become wise.One of my <strong>personal experiences</strong> related to the answers to the reflection questions from the poem above is that I also made the mistake of not listening to my parent's advice. They say that I should be careful in choosing my friends and not give my all, especially to new friends. I didn't believe it and it turned out that my new friend wasn't a nice person and I regretted it. Older people aren't always right, but they certainly have learned a lot and we should listen to them more in our youth.<p></p><p><strong>See more examples of poem reflection</strong></p><p>https://brainly.ph/question/1940644</p><p><strong>#SPJ1</strong></p><br />
