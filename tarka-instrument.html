A</p><p>14. B</p><p>15. A</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>Varied cultures that developed in Latin America gave rise to the different 
</p><p>types of wind and percussion instruments. As with the African continent, Latin 
</p><p>America’s rich history, dating back thousand of years to the Aztec, Maya, and other 
</p><p>ancient cultural groups, understandably generated diverse creative approaches in 
</p><p>making music.
</p><p>Well known Latin American percussion instruments include the conga and 
</p><p>claves. Conga are large hand drums which the musicians has to stand to play. 
</p><p>Claves are short wooden stick which have a surprisingly clear sound, even in large 
</p><p>ensemble and play many of the central rhythms used in Latin American music.Cow 
</p><p>bells and timbales also feature along side other instruments in the salsa band.</p><p>Aztec and Mayan Instruments
</p><p>In Central America, the ancient civilizations of Aztec and Maya people used various 
</p><p>instruments mainly for religious functions and these were usually played by 
</p><p>professional musicians. Some instruments were considered holy and it was further 
</p><p>believed that music was supposed to glorify the gods. Mistakes in playing these 
</p><p>instruments were considered offensive and insulting to them. Among these ancient 
</p><p>instruments are the following:
</p><p>1. Tlapitzalli - is a flute variety from the Aztec culture made of clay with 
</p><p>decorations of abstract designs or images of their deities.
</p><p>2. Teponaztli - is a Mexican slit drum hollowed out and carved from a piece of 
</p><p>hardwood.
</p><p>3. Concha - a wind instrument usually made from the shell of a large sea snail.
</p><p>4. Rasp - a hand percussion instrument whose sound is produced by scraping a 
</p><p>stick(or similar object )that has a series of indentations or notches with another stick, 
</p><p>creating rattling effects.
</p><p>5. Huehueti -is an upright tubular drum used by the Aztecs and other ancient 
</p><p>civilizations. It is made of wood opened at the bottom and standing on three legs cut 
</p><p>from the base.</p><p>Incan Musical Instruments
</p><p>Among the Incas of South America, two instrumental varieties were most common:
</p><p>1. Ocarina - is an ancient vessel flute made of clay or ceramic with four or 12 finger 
</p><p>holes and a mouthpiece that projects from the body.</p><p>2. Zampoñas - or panpipes are ancient instruments from the Andes Mountains of 
</p><p>South America. They typically feature bamboo tubes of different lengths tied together 
</p><p>either in pairs or more to produce graduated pitches of sound. They are played by 
</p><p>blowing over the top of the tubes in the same way one might blow over an empty 
</p><p>soda bottle to create a musical note.</p><p> Andean Musical Instruments
</p><p>The Andean highlands also had their own varieties of flutes and string instruments 
</p><p>that include the following:
</p><p>Siku - (panpipe) is originally from the Aymaras of Peru and Bolivia.It is 
</p><p>traditionally found all across the Andes, and is the main instrument used in a 
</p><p>musical genre known as sikuri.The pipes are made from bamboo tubes, but have 
</p><p>also been made from condor feathers,bone, and many other materials.Siku is a split 
</p><p>across two rows of pipes. The player must alternate rows with every note in order to 
</p><p>play a complete scale.
</p><p>Songo, or shallow-walled bamboo, gives louder, more resonant sound than a 
</p><p>regular deep-walled bamboo,but is less common due to its fragility.
</p><p>1.Wooden Tarka - is a vertical duct flute with a mouthpiece similar to that of a 
</p><p>recorder. It is used during the rainy season and in tribal ceremonies to mimic bird 
</p><p>sounds.It sounds very primitive, soft, and mellow with a rasp in the low range.
</p><p>2.Quena - is a vertical cane flute made from fragile bamboo.It is used duringdry 
</p><p>season and has six finger holes and one thumb hole, open on both ends or the 
</p><p>bottom is half-closed.
</p><p>3.Charango - is a ten-stringed Andean guitar from Bolivia. It is the size of a ukulele 
</p><p>and is a smaller version of the mandolin, imitating the early guitar and lute brought 
</p><p>by the Spaniards.It produces bright sounds and used in serenades in Southern Peru.</p><p>MARIACHI is an extremely popular band in Mexico whose original ensemble is 
</p><p>consisted of violins, guitar,harp, and enormous guitar on(acoustic bass 
</p><p>guitar)Trumpets later replaced the harp.Mariachi music is extremely passionate andromantic with its blended harmonies and catchy rhythms.Its musicians are distinctly 
</p><p>dressed in wide-brimmed hats, jackets, and pants adorned with silver buttons.</p><br />
