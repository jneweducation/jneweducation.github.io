Talk about it to God. He can handle it. He knows what you're thinking anyway and wants to hear from you! 2. Ask God's forgiveness when you've taken your eyes off of Him and forgotten to communicate with Him. 3. Ask for the ability to let go of all the anger and self pity. You cannot get rid of it in your own strength 4. Rest and eat right. It is important that you rest and have proper nourishment. ILO CITY INITIAT 5. Don't quit.

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p>I would definitely do that and I know that God really helps us in our problems more than any people so more than anything put God first.Yes we all have sins and we just ony focus on what we want and to our own dreams and forget God's plans for us that is really the best to all of us. I am going to confess to God of all of my worries ans sins.Anger and self pity emotions are really hard to fight and cannot get rid of my own only. so I'm going to find someone that will help me and give me more hopes to fight.Eating is the main source of our strength so I'll never forget to eat and sleep well and just care about my health so that i will live longer.Yes because quiting to the fights means you're a loser, everything is hard and not so easy so all our need to do is to be strong and keep going in our paths with the help of God.<br />
