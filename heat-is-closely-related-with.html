Weather is the continuous changing condition of air around us. These changes can take many different forms, including wind, rain and snow. It has five types such as sunny, cloudy, windy, snowy, and rainy. It is sunny when there is little to no presence of clouds. It is cloudy when the clouds form up a barrier to block the rays of the sun. At the same time, it also traps heat from the ground. It is windy, when wind gusts form as air is pushed into smaller and smaller spaces. In some countries, except tropical countries like the Philippines, they have snow. When the clouds are heavy enough, they cannot hold the water or snow anymore. They then fall in the form of raindrops, in the case of rain, or snowflakes, in the case of snow. When it rains or snows, many persons are often forced to stay indoors. Weather also affects one's choice of clothes. One wears light clothes when the weather is hot and thick, close- fitting clothes when it is cold.​</a>

It is believed that negligible amount of energy was released when planetesimals ran into each other or due to accretion. ________4-5. Radioactive decay is the process in which a stable atomic nucleus loses energy in the form of particles or electromagnetic waves and transforms towards an unstable nucleus.________6. Uranium is a special kind of element because when it decays, heat is produced. It is this heat that keeps the earth from cooling off completely.________7. Radioactive decay is still a source of heat. ________8. Through a gravitational sorting process called accretion, the denser and heavier parts were drawn to the center and the less dense areas were displaced outwards. ________9. Magmatism is the emplacement of magma within and at the surface of the outer layers of a terrestrial planet. ________10. Magma forms when the temperature is low enough to melt them.________11. Temperature decreases the more distant you go below the earth’s surface. ________12. Pressure decreases as you go deeper below Earth's surface.________13. Melting triggered by a reduction in pressure is called decompression melting.________14. If a rock is already close to its melting point, the effect of removing water can be enough to trigger partial melting. This type of melting is called flux-induced melting.​</a>

Texts are written for a variety of purposes, using different forms and standards of composition. These forms of writing are known as text types. The phrase "Text type" is a way of classifying and defining different types of language interaction, both spoken and written. It refers to the purpose of a text and the way it is written. Here are some examples of different text types: Classification - Explanation • Enumeration Time order Classification-It classifies, describes, and gives information about people, animals and things or phenomena. Weather is the continuous changing conditions of air around us. These changes can take many forms, including wind, rain, and show. They influence how people live every day. When it rains or snows, many persons are often forced to stay indoors. Weather also affects one's choice of clothes. One wears light clothes when the weather is hot and thick, close-fitting clothes when it is cold. Explanation-A factual text type that explains how or why something happen. It begins with the topic, describes items related to the topic in the right order, and explains how these items are related to each other. It may have a conclusion. This type is written in the present tense. The building of gases in the Earth's atmosphere causes the greenhouse effect. With so many gases in the atmosphere, Earth becomes like a greenhouse because the heat from the surface cannot easily escape into the outer space. Because of the gases that block the heat from escaping to the outer space, there is global warming, thus, the temperature of the Earth rises a Guide Questions: 1. What are the first two types of text according to purpose? 2. What is the difference between classification text and explanation text?​</a>

Hyperthermia Case Study
It was July 20 in Houston and the fourth straight day that would have a high temperature above 100°F. Janice was running some errands and decided to stop by her mother's house. Janice's mother, Marian, was eighty-four and in pretty good health. She was able to keep up with her housekeeping and still tended a small garden in her backyard. Just that morning, Janice had told her mother not to spend too much time working in the garden today. Janice knew that the heat could be dangerous, especially to the elderly, and her mother's place didn't have an air conditioner, but Janice felt that her mother was alert enough to know her own limits.
When Janice reached her mother's house, she found her mother unconscious on the couch in the living room. All of the windows in the house were closed. Janice immediately tried to rouse her mother and was able to get her to say a few words, but Marian seemed delirious. Janice grabbed the telephone and called for help. The emergency services operator instructed Janice to apply cold wash cloths to her mother's forehead and face and if possible to position her mother in front of a fan while using a spray bottle to spray tepid water on her skin.
When the paramedics arrived Marian was conscious but confused and feeling nauseous. At the hospital the doctor told Janice just how lucky she was to have visited Marian at that moment. He informed Janice that Marian had suffered heat stroke, a form of hyperthermia and that Janice's quick action at the house had saved her mother's life. Marian was making rapid progress to recovery but was being given fluids and electrolytes intravenously and was going to stay in the hospital overnight for observation.
Case Background
Hyperthermia occurs when the body temperature increases without an increase in the set point of the thermoregulatory center in the hypothalamus. Heat exhaustion and heatstroke are two common forms of hyperthermia. Symptoms of heat exhaustion include thirst, fatigue, profuse sweat, and giddiness or delirium. Individuals with heat exhaustion generally have a normal or only slightly elevated body temperature and the symptoms are the result of the loss of water and electrolytes. Symptoms of heatstroke include a temperature of 104°F, absence of sweating, and loss of consciousness. If untreated, heat exhaustion precedes heatstroke, and heat stroke is often fatal. Treatment for hyperthermia consists of reducing the body temperature to normal. Special attention is placed on reducing the temperature of the brain as tissue damage can result if the body temperature rises above 109°F.
Define homeostasis and describe how it relates to hyperthermia.
 
Explain why elderly individuals with poor circulation would have a greater risk of suffering heat exhaustion or heatstroke.
 
Explain why spraying water on the skin while sitting in front of a fan would lower body temperature.
 
When attempting to lower a person's body temperature in response to hyperthermia one should avoid treatments that induce shivering or vasoconstriction. Why?</a>

Weather is the continuous changing condition of air around us. These changes can take many different forms, including wind, rain and snow. It has five types such as sunny, cloudy, windy, snowy, and rainy. It is sunny when there is little to no presence of clouds. It is cloudy when the clouds form up a barrier to block the rays of the sun. At the same time, it also traps heat from the ground. It is windy, when wind gusts form as air is pushed into smaller and smaller spaces. In some countries, except tropical countries like the Philippines, they have snow. When the clouds are heavy enough, they cannot hold the water or snow anymore. They then fall in the form of raindrops, in the case of rain, or snowflakes, in the case of snow. When it rains or snows, many persons are often forced to stay indoors. Weather also affects one's choice of clothes. One wears light clothes when the weather is hot and thick, close- fitting clothes when it is cold.​</h2><br />

It is believed that negligible amount of energy was released when planetesimals ran into each other or due to accretion. ________4-5. Radioactive decay is the process in which a stable atomic nucleus loses energy in the form of particles or electromagnetic waves and transforms towards an unstable nucleus.________6. Uranium is a special kind of element because when it decays, heat is produced. It is this heat that keeps the earth from cooling off completely.________7. Radioactive decay is still a source of heat. ________8. Through a gravitational sorting process called accretion, the denser and heavier parts were drawn to the center and the less dense areas were displaced outwards. ________9. Magmatism is the emplacement of magma within and at the surface of the outer layers of a terrestrial planet. ________10. Magma forms when the temperature is low enough to melt them.________11. Temperature decreases the more distant you go below the earth’s surface. ________12. Pressure decreases as you go deeper below Earth's surface.________13. Melting triggered by a reduction in pressure is called decompression melting.________14. If a rock is already close to its melting point, the effect of removing water can be enough to trigger partial melting. This type of melting is called flux-induced melting.​</h2><br />

                            16. Read Introduction part-text types: classification, explanation.explanation, enumeration.and time order. Texts are written for a variety of purposes, using different forms and standards of composition. These forms of writing are known as text types. The phrase "Text type" is a way of classifying and defining different types of language interaction, both spoken and written. It refers to the purpose of a text and the way it is written. Here are some examples of different text types: Classification - Explanation • Enumeration Time order Classification-It classifies, describes, and gives information about people, animals and things or phenomena. Weather is the continuous changing conditions of air around us. These changes can take many forms, including wind, rain, and show. They influence how people live every day. When it rains or snows, many persons are often forced to stay indoors. Weather also affects one's choice of clothes. One wears light clothes when the weather is hot and thick, close-fitting clothes when it is cold. Explanation-A factual text type that explains how or why something happen. It begins with the topic, describes items related to the topic in the right order, and explains how these items are related to each other. It may have a conclusion. This type is written in the present tense. The building of gases in the Earth's atmosphere causes the greenhouse effect. With so many gases in the atmosphere, Earth becomes like a greenhouse because the heat from the surface cannot easily escape into the outer space. Because of the gases that block the heat from escaping to the outer space, there is global warming, thus, the temperature of the Earth rises a Guide Questions: 1. What are the first two types of text according to purpose? 2. What is the difference between classification text and explanation text?​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p></p><p>1.Broadly speaking, there are two main text types, factual and literary. Within these are many more narrowly defined text types. Factual text types include such types as factual description, recount, or persuasive. Literary text types include such types as poetry, narrative or personal response.</p><p></p><p>2.Text classification also known as text tagging or text categorization is the process of categorizing text into organized groups. By using Natural Language Processing (NLP), text classifiers can automatically analyze text and then assign a set of pre-defined tags or categories based on its content.</p><br />

Hyperthermia Case Study
It was July 20 in Houston and the fourth straight day that would have a high temperature above 100°F. Janice was running some errands and decided to stop by her mother's house. Janice's mother, Marian, was eighty-four and in pretty good health. She was able to keep up with her housekeeping and still tended a small garden in her backyard. Just that morning, Janice had told her mother not to spend too much time working in the garden today. Janice knew that the heat could be dangerous, especially to the elderly, and her mother's place didn't have an air conditioner, but Janice felt that her mother was alert enough to know her own limits.
When Janice reached her mother's house, she found her mother unconscious on the couch in the living room. All of the windows in the house were closed. Janice immediately tried to rouse her mother and was able to get her to say a few words, but Marian seemed delirious. Janice grabbed the telephone and called for help. The emergency services operator instructed Janice to apply cold wash cloths to her mother's forehead and face and if possible to position her mother in front of a fan while using a spray bottle to spray tepid water on her skin.
When the paramedics arrived Marian was conscious but confused and feeling nauseous. At the hospital the doctor told Janice just how lucky she was to have visited Marian at that moment. He informed Janice that Marian had suffered heat stroke, a form of hyperthermia and that Janice's quick action at the house had saved her mother's life. Marian was making rapid progress to recovery but was being given fluids and electrolytes intravenously and was going to stay in the hospital overnight for observation.
Case Background
Hyperthermia occurs when the body temperature increases without an increase in the set point of the thermoregulatory center in the hypothalamus. Heat exhaustion and heatstroke are two common forms of hyperthermia. Symptoms of heat exhaustion include thirst, fatigue, profuse sweat, and giddiness or delirium. Individuals with heat exhaustion generally have a normal or only slightly elevated body temperature and the symptoms are the result of the loss of water and electrolytes. Symptoms of heatstroke include a temperature of 104°F, absence of sweating, and loss of consciousness. If untreated, heat exhaustion precedes heatstroke, and heat stroke is often fatal. Treatment for hyperthermia consists of reducing the body temperature to normal. Special attention is placed on reducing the temperature of the brain as tissue damage can result if the body temperature rises above 109°F.
Define homeostasis and describe how it relates to hyperthermia.
 
Explain why elderly individuals with poor circulation would have a greater risk of suffering heat exhaustion or heatstroke.
 
Explain why spraying water on the skin while sitting in front of a fan would lower body temperature.
 
When attempting to lower a person's body temperature in response to hyperthermia one should avoid treatments that induce shivering or vasoconstriction. Why?</h2><br />
