                                            In a queer fittle bamboo house in front of a big garden hved a man and his wife all alone. They had always been kind and good to everyone, but still they were not happy, because the child for which they longed had never come to them. Each day for many years they had prayed for a son or a daughter, but their prayers had been unanswered. Now that they were growing old, they believed that they must always live alone. In the garden near their house, this couple grew fine white squash, and as the vines bore the year around, they had never been in need of food. One day, however, they discovered that no new squash had formed to take the place of those they had picked, and for the first time in many seasons they had no vegetables. Each day they examined the vines, and though the big, yellow flowers continued to bloom and fade, no squash grew on the stems. Finally, one morning after a long wait, the woman cried out with delight, for she had discovered a little green squash. After examining it, they decided to let it ripen that they might have the seeds to plant. They eagerly watched it grow, and it became a beautiful white vegetable, but by the time it was large enough for food they were so hungry that they decided to eat it. They brought a large knife and picked it, but scarcely had they started to open it when a voice cried out from within, "Please be careful that you do not hurt me." The man and woman stopped their work, for they thought that a spirit must have spoken to them. But when the voice again called and begged them to open the squash, they carefully opened it, and there inside was a nice baby boy [1] He could already stand alone and could talk. And the man and his wife were overjoyed. 1. squash is the only food that the couple eats every day. from this statement tell the setting of the story and the source of income of the people? 2. what negative trait does the couple possessed? 3. if we are to analyze the couples characters they were not as greedy as day were when they are still poor what do you think have changed their behavior? 4. what do you think will happen if the couple became contented with that they had? 5. what lesson did the story taught us? pls give me correct answer​</a>

                                            *The Tale of the White Squash*There once lived a couple who had a squash plant that gave them food to eat every day. Despite being childless both were happy for they liked nothing so much as boiled squash for dinner.One day they discovered that they had eaten their last squash. They waited patiently but no new fruit came. Oh God? They prayed, if you please give us some more squash fruit. Not long after, a white squash appeared. They were astonished for it was the first white squash they had ever seen. The couple could hardly wait for the fruit to ripen as soon as it was big enough, the husband said: “wife, pick the fruit and before she opened it, she heard a voice from it. “Please don’t hurt me” said the voice.“Husband” cried the woman “come here” this squash can talk. Don’t be afool, replied her husband. At your age you ought to know that no squash can talk. “But please do not hurt me”, said the voice. Upon hearing the man,himself took the knife and carefully cut the fruit open. And a beautiful baby stood up and smiled.“Thank you for letting let me out.”After recovering from their surprised the wife proceeded to fetch water from the well. She spread a mat on the floor and laid the baby on it. She started to bathe in the baby but to her surprise, the water splashed on the baby’s body rolled down to the mat as shining piece of gold. The couple had been so delighted to have the baby that it had seemed as if there was nothing more to wish for, but now that the gold had come to them also they were happier than ever. The next morning the woman gave the baby another bath, and again the water turned to gold. They now had enough money to build a large house. The third morning she brought water for his bath again, but he grew very sad and flew away. At the same time all the gold disappeared also, and the man and his wife were left poor and alone.Analysis and Discussion:1. Who were the main characters in the story?2. What did they see after cutting the squash carefully?3. What happens every time the wife bathes the baby?4. Did the couple appreciate the opportunity given to them?5.

                            15. Please answer with explanation!
Mang Ben and Aling Julie have 3 children who are all studying abroad. One of their children returns home after two years, the second every three years and the last one, every five years. Last December 1992 there was a big family reunion, the children left to return to their studies abroad. The old couple is waiting again for another reunion. For how long will they have to wait to be with their children again? What year will that be?</h2><br />
                        <p></p><p></p><p>To answer this problem, we need to find the least common multiple (LCM) of 2, 3, and 5, which represents the number of years that will pass before all three children return at the same time.</p><p></p><p>The prime factors of 2, 3, and 5 are:</p><p></p><p>2: 2</p><p>3: 3</p><p>5: 5</p><p></p><p>To find the LCM, we need to take the highest exponent of each prime factor that appears in any of the numbers:</p><p></p><p>2² x 3 x 5 = 60</p><p></p><p>Therefore, the old couple will have to wait for 60 years before they can see their children again at a family reunion. To find the year, we add 60 years to 1992:</p><p></p><p>1992 + 60 = 2052</p><p></p><p>So they will have to wait until the year 2052 to have another family reunion with all their children.</p><br />

                            16. In a queer fittle bamboo house in front of a big garden hved a man and his wife all alone. They had always been kind and good to everyone, but still they were not happy, because the child for which they longed had never come to them. Each day for many years they had prayed for a son or a daughter, but their prayers had been unanswered. Now that they were growing old, they believed that they must always live alone. In the garden near their house, this couple grew fine white squash, and as the vines bore the year around, they had never been in need of food. One day, however, they discovered that no new squash had formed to take the place of those they had picked, and for the first time in many seasons they had no vegetables. Each day they examined the vines, and though the big, yellow flowers continued to bloom and fade, no squash grew on the stems. Finally, one morning after a long wait, the woman cried out with delight, for she had discovered a little green squash. After examining it, they decided to let it ripen that they might have the seeds to plant. They eagerly watched it grow, and it became a beautiful white vegetable, but by the time it was large enough for food they were so hungry that they decided to eat it. They brought a large knife and picked it, but scarcely had they started to open it when a voice cried out from within, "Please be careful that you do not hurt me." The man and woman stopped their work, for they thought that a spirit must have spoken to them. But when the voice again called and begged them to open the squash, they carefully opened it, and there inside was a nice baby boy [1] He could already stand alone and could talk. And the man and his wife were overjoyed. 1. squash is the only food that the couple eats every day. from this statement tell the setting of the story and the source of income of the people? 2. what negative trait does the couple possessed? 3. if we are to analyze the couples characters they were not as greedy as day were when they are still poor what do you think have changed their behavior? 4. what do you think will happen if the couple became contented with that they had? 5. what lesson did the story taught us? pls give me correct answer​</h2><br />

                            24. *The Tale of the White Squash*There once lived a couple who had a squash plant that gave them food to eat every day. Despite being childless both were happy for they liked nothing so much as boiled squash for dinner.One day they discovered that they had eaten their last squash. They waited patiently but no new fruit came. Oh God? They prayed, if you please give us some more squash fruit. Not long after, a white squash appeared. They were astonished for it was the first white squash they had ever seen. The couple could hardly wait for the fruit to ripen as soon as it was big enough, the husband said: “wife, pick the fruit and before she opened it, she heard a voice from it. “Please don’t hurt me” said the voice.“Husband” cried the woman “come here” this squash can talk. Don’t be afool, replied her husband. At your age you ought to know that no squash can talk. “But please do not hurt me”, said the voice. Upon hearing the man,himself took the knife and carefully cut the fruit open. And a beautiful baby stood up and smiled.“Thank you for letting let me out.”After recovering from their surprised the wife proceeded to fetch water from the well. She spread a mat on the floor and laid the baby on it. She started to bathe in the baby but to her surprise, the water splashed on the baby’s body rolled down to the mat as shining piece of gold. The couple had been so delighted to have the baby that it had seemed as if there was nothing more to wish for, but now that the gold had come to them also they were happier than ever. The next morning the woman gave the baby another bath, and again the water turned to gold. They now had enough money to build a large house. The third morning she brought water for his bath again, but he grew very sad and flew away. At the same time all the gold disappeared also, and the man and his wife were left poor and alone.Analysis and Discussion:1. Who were the main characters in the story?2. What did they see after cutting the squash carefully?3. What happens every time the wife bathes the baby?4. Did the couple appreciate the opportunity given to them?5. Explain “Money is the root of all evil”. Is this saying true in the story?​</h2><br />
