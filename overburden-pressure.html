We now have more than six million cases of COVID-19 across the world and have lost more than 370,000 people to the virus. As we work with governments across the world to suppress the virus and accelerate science around diagnostics, therapeutics and vaccines, we also continue to respond to other health emergencies and new disease outbreaks. We all know that the impacts of COVID-19 extend well beyond the death and disease caused by the virus itself. The pandemic has forced countries to make difficult choices about suspending some health services Building on previous guidance on maintaining CHECK YOUR UNDERSTANDING essential health services through the COVID-19 pandemic, today we are providing operational guidance on how best to put that into practice. Ensuring coordination and development of new ways to deliver care while limiting visits to health facilities are keys to keeping people safe and ensuring health systems are not overburdened.

Bernadette)Similar to other countries, the public health system in the Philippines was unprepared forand overburdened by COVID-19. The first case was reported on January 30 when a Chinese womanreached the country from Wuhan, China, and then a few days later her male companion died ofthe virus - making it the first recorded death outside of China (Department of Health (DOH), 2020b;Ramzy and May, 2020; World Health Organization (WHO), 2020a). By March 7, the first case oflocal transmission was confirmed (DOH, 2020a; WHO, 2020a). To date, there are 112,593confirmed cases, 6,263 new cases, and 2,115 deaths in the country (WHO, 2020b) - making the Philippines as one of the most highly impacted in Southeast Asia and the Western Pacific RegionEqually alarming is the number of doctors, nurses, and other hospital staff who get infected and die of COVID-19 (CNN Philippines, 2020a; McCarthy, 2020). Recently, professional medical and allied medical associations have called for a unified and calibrated response and temporaryquarantine of the country's capital to avoid a total collapse of the healthcare system (Batnag, 2020).Critical but seldom discussed are the challenges of journalism in making sense of the rapid spread and devastating impact of COVID-19 in the Philippines and how the pandemic is also gradually transforming journalism in the country.Questions: 1.

                                            What is John F. Kennedy's purpose in this excerpt from his inaugural address?   But neither can two great and powerful groups of nations take comfort from our present course—both sides overburdened by the cost of modern weapons, both rightly alarmed by the steady spread of the deadly atom, yet both racing to alter that uncertain balance of terror that stays the hand of mankind's final war.  So let us begin anew—remembering on both sides that civility is not a sign of weakness, and sincerity is always subject to proof. Let us never negotiate out of fear. But let us never fear to negotiate.  Let both sides explore what problems unite us instead of belaboring those problems which divide us.  Let both sides, for the first time, formulate serious and precise proposals for the inspection and control of arms—and bring the absolute power to destroy other nations under the absolute control of all nations.  Let both sides seek to invoke the wonders of science instead of its terrors. Together let us explore the stars, conquer the deserts, eradicate disease, tap the ocean depths, and encourage the arts and commerce.  Let both sides unite to heed in all corners of the earth the command of Isaiah—to "undo the heavy burdens ... and to let the oppressed go free."
A)to emphasize the financial burden of maintaining a nation's defense
B)to explain the need to solve social problems that plague the world
C)to urge nations to make peace instead of war
D)to clarify the government’s stance on nations posing a threat to peace</a>

We now have more than six million cases of COVID-19 across the world and have lost more than 370,000 people to the virus. As we work with governments across the world to suppress the virus and accelerate science around diagnostics, therapeutics and vaccines, we also continue to respond to other health emergencies and new disease outbreaks. We all know that the impacts of COVID-19 extend well beyond the death and disease caused by the virus itself. The pandemic has forced countries to make difficult choices about suspending some health services Building on previous guidance on maintaining CHECK YOUR UNDERSTANDING essential health services through the COVID-19 pandemic, today we are providing operational guidance on how best to put that into practice. Ensuring coordination and development of new ways to deliver care while limiting visits to health facilities are keys to keeping people safe and ensuring health systems are not overburdened.

Bernadette)Similar to other countries, the public health system in the Philippines was unprepared forand overburdened by COVID-19. The first case was reported on January 30 when a Chinese womanreached the country from Wuhan, China, and then a few days later her male companion died ofthe virus - making it the first recorded death outside of China (Department of Health (DOH), 2020b;Ramzy and May, 2020; World Health Organization (WHO), 2020a). By March 7, the first case oflocal transmission was confirmed (DOH, 2020a; WHO, 2020a). To date, there are 112,593confirmed cases, 6,263 new cases, and 2,115 deaths in the country (WHO, 2020b) - making the Philippines as one of the most highly impacted in Southeast Asia and the Western Pacific RegionEqually alarming is the number of doctors, nurses, and other hospital staff who get infected and die of COVID-19 (CNN Philippines, 2020a; McCarthy, 2020). Recently, professional medical and allied medical associations have called for a unified and calibrated response and temporaryquarantine of the country's capital to avoid a total collapse of the healthcare system (Batnag, 2020).Critical but seldom discussed are the challenges of journalism in making sense of the rapid spread and devastating impact of COVID-19 in the Philippines and how the pandemic is also gradually transforming journalism in the country.Questions: 1.

                            17. Your client wants to save money for his dream car. As financial adviser, your client asks you to present detailed computation for his initial plan and counsel him which is more preferable. His plans are as follows: His target is to save up to P1M so that he will not be overburdened by a large mortgage after purchasing the car. Calculate the least number of monthly savings until it reaches the 1-M target. He has two options to choose from. OPTION 1. Make monthly deposits of P3000 in a savings account that earns 3.5% interest per month and double the savings yearly in the succeeding years. OPTION 2. Make an initial deposit of P3000 in a savings account that earns 3.5% and increase the monthly deposit by P1000 until you reach the 1-M target. Show the detailed computation applying the concept of sequences and series and advice the client which option is more preferably.​</h2><br />

                            24. What is John F. Kennedy's purpose in this excerpt from his inaugural address?   But neither can two great and powerful groups of nations take comfort from our present course—both sides overburdened by the cost of modern weapons, both rightly alarmed by the steady spread of the deadly atom, yet both racing to alter that uncertain balance of terror that stays the hand of mankind's final war.  So let us begin anew—remembering on both sides that civility is not a sign of weakness, and sincerity is always subject to proof. Let us never negotiate out of fear. But let us never fear to negotiate.  Let both sides explore what problems unite us instead of belaboring those problems which divide us.  Let both sides, for the first time, formulate serious and precise proposals for the inspection and control of arms—and bring the absolute power to destroy other nations under the absolute control of all nations.  Let both sides seek to invoke the wonders of science instead of its terrors. Together let us explore the stars, conquer the deserts, eradicate disease, tap the ocean depths, and encourage the arts and commerce.  Let both sides unite to heed in all corners of the earth the command of Isaiah—to "undo the heavy burdens ... and to let the oppressed go free."
A)to emphasize the financial burden of maintaining a nation's defense
B)to explain the need to solve social problems that plague the world
C)to urge nations to make peace instead of war
D)to clarify the government’s stance on nations posing a threat to peace</h2><br />
