                                            For years, Indonesia was dominated by foreign countries especially from Europe. The political strife Indonesia suffered from 1500 until 1949 can be the basis of the poem, "To Gadis." Read the poem below. Then, answer the questions that follow.To Gadisby Chairil AnwarAmidstThe green leavesThe light and open fields,Innocent children just able to crawl, the fresh, invigorating rain.Sweet-singing birds,A young nation rises that can just say "I"And thenThe crisp dry wind, the scorched earth, The swirling sand blown back,The evacuated land.We are wedged in And forced to shrink, grow small, Able to move a step only now and then.Let us free ourselves, our souls, become A winging dove,Fly And know the fields without meeting and withoutThe consummation of flight.Comprehension Questions:1. What images are used to characterize this situation in the first stanza?2. What literal situation is depicted in it?3. As a Filipino, what is your dream for the nation?4. Why is Indonesia described as "A young nation... that can just say 'I"? 5. Why do people need to write about their own country's struggles and how they fought to attain freedom and liberty?​</a>

O God will try to push me down but I             With all my force will push Him back.      He shall not be able to put out Love at all.      O I'll guard it, guard it, guard it!

I believe that the poet here refers to the colonizers, but the poet skillfully uses God in each of the line.

What images are used to characterize this situation in the first stanza?2. What literal situation is depicted in it?3. As a Filipino, what is your dream for the nation?4. Why is Indonesia described as "A young nation... that can just say 'I"? 5.
