                                            The World Health Organization (WHO), continuously advice the people to 
follow the precautionary measures as a temporary solution to avoid being infected 
and one of the spreaders of the disease. 
One of this is regular hand washing. This will eliminate the transmission of 
the disease. Bringing and using alcohol or hand sanitizer will be a big help too. 
Second is wearing a mask is a must. In the so called new normal everyone is 
encouraged to wear a mask or face shield for their own safety and protection. Social 
distancing is also strictly implemented in public areas and vehicles. Also, public 
gathering is prohibited to avoid the spread of the disease. 
Another one is, stay at home especially if there is nothing important to do 
outside. If you feel you have a fever, cough and difficulty breathing which is one of 
the symptoms of Covid-19 immediately report it to the nearest health centre for 
monitoring to seek medical attention. Keep away with the people who are sneezing 
or coughing. And if you feel the same do not hesitate to cover your mouth or nose 
with your elbow or a tissue. 
 These are the possible solutions as of now while each of as is waiting for the 
vaccine. Together let’s have self-discipline this is the key to prevent the spread of the 
virus.

                            5. The World Health Organization (WHO), continuously advice the people to 
follow the precautionary measures as a temporary solution to avoid being infected 
and one of the spreaders of the disease. 
One of this is regular hand washing. This will eliminate the transmission of 
the disease. Bringing and using alcohol or hand sanitizer will be a big help too. 
Second is wearing a mask is a must. In the so called new normal everyone is 
encouraged to wear a mask or face shield for their own safety and protection. Social 
distancing is also strictly implemented in public areas and vehicles. Also, public 
gathering is prohibited to avoid the spread of the disease. 
Another one is, stay at home especially if there is nothing important to do 
outside. If you feel you have a fever, cough and difficulty breathing which is one of 
the symptoms of Covid-19 immediately report it to the nearest health centre for 
monitoring to seek medical attention. Keep away with the people who are sneezing 
or coughing. And if you feel the same do not hesitate to cover your mouth or nose 
with your elbow or a tissue. 
 These are the possible solutions as of now while each of as is waiting for the 
vaccine. Together let’s have self-discipline this is the key to prevent the spread of the 
virus.
