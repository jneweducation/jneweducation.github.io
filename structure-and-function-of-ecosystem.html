structure, function and species compilation within the system. This can get hard
quickly, because everything in an ecosystem affects everything else. Make a
poster/slogan showing how humans can conserve the ecosystem. Write 2-3
sentences about your poster. Use the rubrics below for your reference. (20pts)

                            17. describe how unifying themes (e.g., structure and function, evolution, and ecosystems) in the study of life show the connections among living things and how they interact with each other and with their environment </h2><br />
                        <p>The<strong> unifying themes</strong> just interact with each other through a long and nearly perfected process called evolution, well until humans came along to mess it up. So nearly all things that make life possible comes from the sun’s energy and is then proliferated through consumption and reproduction. It is theorized with ample evidence that the absorption is first undertaken by plants and spreads out into the entire ecosystem through the food chain. It activates the cell structure which enables it to multiply, inducing growth and reproduction along with heredity. Of course, evolution always plays a part in every organism to ensure survival and continuity, and all those who remain have no choice but to be interdependent with each other for survival, thereby creating the environment we recognize.

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>1. The cell is called the structural and functional unit of life as all living organisms are made up of cells. Cells are also essential for performing various life processes required for sustaining life. Furthermore, cells provide form and structure, process nutrients and convert it into useable energy. </p><p>2. Abiotic factors affect the ability of organisms to survive and reproduce. Abiotic factors affect the ecosystem because it limits factors or restrict the growth of populations. They help determine the types and numbers of organisms able to exist within an environment.  My examples of it might include temperature, light, and water.</p><p>3.
