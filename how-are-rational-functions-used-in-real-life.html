FERFORMANCE TASKS) GRASPS Your goal is to prove that you are really studying well by sharing your knowledge and skills in soring quadratic ecuations. You are going to reach your cousins about the moprocedures in solving the solutions of a quadratic suntion Your mudine are your cousins. They have to learn the process of how to obtain the solution of the equation given to them Suppose you are playing with your three cousins, who are all Grade 9 students like you. Your uncle who is a teacher, asked the four of you about how well your studies are since he is always seeing all of you playing games with your phones. All of you answered, "It's OKI To prove it, he then thought of a way to challenge you and your other cousins if you are really studying well. He has set emple challenge to zach of you where anyone who will pass it, will be given a reward of Php 100.00 and a morienda trent. If not, you will be reported to your parents. Your uncle then distributed a piece of paper where an equation is written. Surprisingly, the equations given are the same equations you have encountered during your lessons in Mathematics on the past weeks. You are confident that you will pass the challenge given by your uncle but not your cousins. They seemed to be problematic when they saw such equations. You want to help your cousins so that everybody will be rewarded and no one will be left behind. You dended to help them by teaching them how to obtain the solutions of the equations. </a>

Your uncle who is a teacher, asked the four of you about how well your studies are since he is always seeing all of you playing games with your phones. All of you answered, "It's OKI To prove it, he then thought of a way to challenge you and your other cousins if you are really studying well. He has set emple challenge to zach of you where anyone who will pass it, will be given a reward of Php 100.00 and a morienda trent. If not, you will be reported to your parents. Your uncle then distributed a piece of paper where an equation is written.

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p><strong>What is a rational function?</strong></p><p>A rational function in mathematics is any variable that can be described by a rational fraction, which is an algebraic fraction with polynomials in both the numerator and denominator. Polynomial coefficients do not have to be rational numbers; they might be in any field K. A rational function and a rational fraction over K are used in this situation. The variables' values can be found in any field L containing K. The function's domain is the set of variables' values for which the numerator is not zero, and the codomain is L.</p><p>Any function that can be represented as the ratio of two polynomial functions with the polynomial in the denominator not equal to zero is a rational function.</p><p>Setting the denominator to zero and solving a rational function can reveal its domain constraints. Singularities are x-values when the denominator equals zero and are not in the domain of the function.</p><p></p><p><strong>Rational Function in Real life.</strong></p>Human rationality is broad, and its application spans a wide range of domains. You can see how it works in all of the logically constructed fields. Our capacity for mathematics, reasoning, and a wide range of activities, including art in its varied forms. These are examples of what Kant would call "pure" rational functions, and they demonstrate an inner inclination of the human mind and how it operates when performing logical/rational tasks.Chemicals, meals, water, and gases are examples of substances that can be used to make mixtures. Mixtures can develop in a variety of ways, both naturally and as a means of producing a desired product or end. Chemical spills, manufacturing, and even biochemical reactions are all examples of mixes. When components of a mixture are added at variable rates and concentrations, mixtures can become mathematically interesting. We'll develop an equation to simulate the concentration – or sugar-to-water ratio – in a big mixing tank over time in our previous example. You're being asked if the sugar concentration at the end is higher than it was at the start.A "work problem" is a real-life scenario that may be described and addressed with the use of a rational equation. Calculating how long it will take different persons working at different rates to complete a task is a common task problem. The rational equations resulting from the work formula, W = r t, are frequently used in algebraic models of similar circumstances. (Notice how the work formula is extremely similar to the distance, rate, and time equation, or d = r t.) The product of the rate of work (r) and the time spent working equals the amount of work done (W) (t). There are three versions of the work formula.<p></p><p></p><p>To know more about rational function, click here</p><p>https://brainly.ph/question/4580918</p><p></p><p>Hope this helps! :)
