                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>did the light form straight line when you focused celing without blockage?</p><p>yes, the light forms a straight line when you aimed it on the wall or ceiling without blockage in its path. Light travels in a space or a vacuum and always travels in a straight line until it hits an object that can change its direction. A shadow is a piece of evidence that light always travels in a straight line</p><p></p><p>when you blocked the light with thick cardboard, was throught it?</p><p>no, The cardboard is too thick for the light to pass through</p><p></p><p>when you aligned the cardboards wih holes, was the pass throught it?</p><p>yes,because it has holes and light it can pass through it.</p><p></p><p>when one of the cardboards was not aligned with cardboards, was the light able to pass through the other why is this so?</p><p>yes, because it is flaming that is why this can pass through</p><p></p><p>what can you say about the way light travels?</p><p>Light waves travel out from their source in straight lines called rays. Rays do not curve around corners, so when they hit an opaque object (one that does not allow light to pass through it), they are blocked from reaching the other side of that object.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p> paki mark brainliest </p><p></p><p>#carryonlearning</p><br />
