                                            3. Ways to Lessen the Occurrence of Landslides 1. Adopt selective cutting- logging companies must allow old trees to remain. This method cuts down mature or inferior kind of trees to encourage the growth of the remaining trees in the forest. 2. Do alley-cropping instead of slash-and-burn method. Alley-cropping is a method of simultaneously growing an agricultural crop with a tree crop, retaining soil fertility. Plant more trees with strong root structures that hold the soil together. 4. The government must set mining rules based on the evaluation of slope stability and landslide threat in the mining areas. Mining companies must follow these rules. In case of disobedience, temporary or permanent suspension of mining operations must be implemented. 5. Avoid construction on steep slopes. As this is not entirely possible, evaluation on the area for land development should be performed by engineers and geologists 6. Construct proper drainage away from the slope to control water accuratation and to avoid slope instability. 7. Check broken or leaking pipes during because oversaturation or oil with water can trigger landslides. ​</a>

                                            Read each paragraph. Then select the answer that best describes the author’s purpose and perspectives in writing.  Until the 1960s, people in the United States did not particularly pay attention to the natural environment. Rather, Americans were more focused on the economy. However, with an increase in oil spills, polluting factories and power plants, and the loss of wilderness, suddenly  people  realizes they shared  common values.  They called for a national  organization  to protect  the environment. Accordingly, on April 22, 1970, the first Earth DAY, 20 MILLION Americans  took to the streets, parks  and auditoriums  to demonstrate  for a healthy, sustainable  environment. Thousands  of colleges  and universities  organized protests against  the  deterioration   of the environment.  The first Earth Day led to the creation of the United States  Environmental  Protection Agency (EPA)  and the passage of the Clean Air, Clean Water, and Endangered   Species Acts. President Richard Nixon and Congress  worked together  to established the EPA in response  to the growing public demand  for cleaner water, air and land. Prior to the establishment of the EPA, the  national government was not structured to make  coordinated attack on the pollutants, which harm  human  health  and degrade  the environment. The EPA  was  assigned  the daunting  task  of repairing  the damage already done  to the natural environment.  Question:  What is the author’s purpose in paragraph 2?  Select one: a. to propose the need for further actions by the government b. to describe how the government became more involved in cleaning the environment c. to discuss public demonstration that demanded a cleaner environment d. to suggest that the government needed to control polluting factories and power plants</a>

                                            Spot the thesis statement in the following passage:  In the 1940s, George Orwell warned “Who controls the past controls the future. Who controls the present controls the past” (Orwell 30). In the 1990s a band called Rage Against the Machine, the name itself referring to a people’s movement to fight against control (corporation, government or otherwise) used this mantra in their song “Testify,” a warning to not silently endure oppression. This warning is not only relevant to the 20th century, but has been applicable since human beings started forming structures of power to control and oppress one another. This can vividly be seen during the times of slavery in the United States when blacks were enslaved for two and a half centuries. In Frederick Douglass’s novel Narrative of the Life of Frederick Douglass, an American Slave, Douglass reveals how this long and brutal control of human beings was partly accomplished through control over literacy. The control and limitations over reading and writing during slavery sought to make slaves like Douglass ignorant, powerless, and therefore more easily controlled, and this control over literacy and education is still happening in the world today.    --Sample essay on Frederick Douglass’s Narrative of the Life of Frederick Douglass, an American Slave  Select one: a.

In the 1940s, George Orwell warned “Who controls the past controls the future. Who controls the present controls the past” (Orwell 30). In the 1990s a band called Rage Against the Machine, the name itself referring to a people’s movement to fight against control (corporation, government or otherwise) used this mantra in their song “Testify,” a warning to not silently endure oppression. This warning is not only relevant to the 20th century, but has been applicable since human beings started forming structures of power to control and oppress one another. This can vividly be seen during the times of slavery in the United States when blacks were enslaved for two and a half centuries. In Frederick Douglass’s novel Narrative of the Life of Frederick Douglass, an American Slave, Douglass reveals how this long and brutal control of human beings was partly accomplished through control over literacy. The control and limitations over reading and writing during slavery sought to make slaves like Douglass ignorant, powerless, and therefore more easily controlled, and this control over literacy and education is still happening in the world today.

Cell membrane (_________) This is a selectively permeable barrier that controls what goes in and out of the cell. 2. Bladder (_________) The bladder is a hollow, muscular organ that collects urine excreted by the kidneys before disposal by urination. 3. Lysosomes (_________) Lysosomes are organelles that contain enzymes to break down and remove waste in the cell. 4. Mitochondria (_________) Mitochondria are the site of cellular respiration in which sugar molecules are broken down to release energy. 5. Skin (_________) The skin is the largest organ of the integumentary system. It protects the underlying muscles, bones, and organs as well contributing to heat regulation and sensory perception. 6. Microtubules (________) Microtubules serve as part of the cell's system of structural support. They are also involved in the process of cellular division. 7. Cardiac (________) Coordinated contractions of cardiac tissue in the heart pump blood throughout the body.8. Digestive (________) Although digestive system take many forms in organisms throughout the world, the main function of digestion is to break down food so that it can be used for energy by the body. 9. Nervous (________) Nervous tissue is the main component of the brain and spinal cord which regulate and control body functions. 10. Epithelial (________) Epithelial tissue is located on the very outside of an organism (i.e.skin) as well as in the lining of hollow organs such as the bladder. Its purpose include protection and secretion. 11. Skeletal (________) The skeletal system is a rigid framework to which the softer tissues and organs of the body are attached. It provides protection and structural support for the body. 12. Urinary (_______) The urinary system produces, stores, and eliminates urinary waste. Through this process, the body is able to regulate electrolyte balance as well as maintain a healthy pH level. 13. Bones (_______) Bones are rigid organs that form part of the endoskeleton of vertebrates. They help to move, support and protect the body as well as producing red and white blood cells. 14. Nucleus (_______) This organelle contains the cell's genetic material (DNA) and therefore controls the cell's activities. 15. Brain (_______) In most vertebrate animals, the brain is the central organ of the nervous system. It controls the other systems of the body by either activating muscles or releasing chemicals. 16. Heart (_______) The heart is a muscular organ found in all animals with a circulatory system. It is responsible for pumping blood throughout the body through the use of coordinated contractions. 17. Endoplasmic Reticulum (________) The endoplasmic reticulum is an organelle that forms an interconnected network of tubules that serve to transport newly synthesized proteins. 18. Stomach (_________) The stomach is a muscular, hollow organ that works with the digestive system. It releases enzymes and strong acids that help to break down food to release useable energy. 19. Circulatory (________) This system transports nutrients (gases, hormones, etc.) carried in blood and lymph throughout tue body. It is powered by the 20. Connective (________) Connective tissue is made of a network of protein fibers that provide structural support. Bone, blood, cartilage, and fat are the four main types of connective tissue. 21. Nervous (_________) This system contains a network of specialized cells called neurons that coordinate actions by transmitting signals throughout the body. 22. Integumentary (________) The Integumentary system consists of the skin and its appendages (hair, feathers, nails, etc.). It serves to protect tye body as well to detect pain, sensation, and pressure. 23. Smooth Muscle (_______) Smooth tissue is able to contract on its own without a signal from the brain. These involuntary contractions help organs such as the stomach and intestines to break down and move food through the digestion process. ​</a>

                        <p>1. Control flow structure refers to the predetermined way in which a program's instructions are executed sequentially in the order in which they are written in the code.</p><p></p><p>2. The purpose of the choice structure is to allow the program to make decisions and take different actions depending on whether certain conditions are true or false. This allows for more complex and flexible behavior from the program since it can react differently to different situations.</p><p></p><p>3. The repeat control structure, also known as a loop, allows the program to repeat a set of statements multiple times, either for a fixed number of iterations or until a specified condition is met. This is useful for tasks that require the same operations to be performed on multiple inputs or for tasks that need to be repeated a specified number of times until a certain condition is met. There are several types of loops, including the while loop, the do-while loop, and the for loop, each with their own specific uses and exit conditions.</p><p></p><br />

It is the simplest control structure and is used to perform a set of statements one after the other.</p><p></p><p>4. Condition selection is a control structure that allows the program to make decisions based on some conditions. In other words, it enables the program to take different paths based on whether a certain condition is true or false. The most common way to implement condition selection is by using if-else statements.</p><p></p><p>5. Repetition/iteration, also known as loops, is a control structure that allows developers to execute a block of code multiple times.

                            4. 3. Ways to Lessen the Occurrence of Landslides 1. Adopt selective cutting- logging companies must allow old trees to remain. This method cuts down mature or inferior kind of trees to encourage the growth of the remaining trees in the forest. 2. Do alley-cropping instead of slash-and-burn method. Alley-cropping is a method of simultaneously growing an agricultural crop with a tree crop, retaining soil fertility. Plant more trees with strong root structures that hold the soil together. 4. The government must set mining rules based on the evaluation of slope stability and landslide threat in the mining areas. Mining companies must follow these rules. In case of disobedience, temporary or permanent suspension of mining operations must be implemented. 5. Avoid construction on steep slopes. As this is not entirely possible, evaluation on the area for land development should be performed by engineers and geologists 6. Construct proper drainage away from the slope to control water accuratation and to avoid slope instability. 7.

Until the 1960s, people in the United States did not particularly pay attention to the natural environment. Rather, Americans were more focused on the economy. However, with an increase in oil spills, polluting factories and power plants, and the loss of wilderness, suddenly  people  realizes they shared  common values.  They called for a national  organization  to protect  the environment. Accordingly, on April 22, 1970, the first Earth DAY, 20 MILLION Americans  took to the streets, parks  and auditoriums  to demonstrate  for a healthy, sustainable  environment. Thousands  of colleges  and universities  organized protests against  the  deterioration   of the environment.  The first Earth Day led to the creation of the United States  Environmental  Protection Agency (EPA)  and the passage of the Clean Air, Clean Water, and Endangered   Species Acts. President Richard Nixon and Congress  worked together  to established the EPA in response  to the growing public demand  for cleaner water, air and land. Prior to the establishment of the EPA, the  national government was not structured to make  coordinated attack on the pollutants, which harm  human  health  and degrade  the environment. The EPA  was  assigned  the daunting  task  of repairing  the damage already done  to the natural environment.  Question:  What is the author’s purpose in paragraph 2?  Select one: a. to propose the need for further actions by the government b. to describe how the government became more involved in cleaning the environment c. to discuss public demonstration that demanded a cleaner environment d. to suggest that the government needed to control polluting factories and power plants</h2><br />

                            10. Spot the thesis statement in the following passage:  In the 1940s, George Orwell warned “Who controls the past controls the future. Who controls the present controls the past” (Orwell 30). In the 1990s a band called Rage Against the Machine, the name itself referring to a people’s movement to fight against control (corporation, government or otherwise) used this mantra in their song “Testify,” a warning to not silently endure oppression. This warning is not only relevant to the 20th century, but has been applicable since human beings started forming structures of power to control and oppress one another. This can vividly be seen during the times of slavery in the United States when blacks were enslaved for two and a half centuries. In Frederick Douglass’s novel Narrative of the Life of Frederick Douglass, an American Slave, Douglass reveals how this long and brutal control of human beings was partly accomplished through control over literacy. The control and limitations over reading and writing during slavery sought to make slaves like Douglass ignorant, powerless, and therefore more easily controlled, and this control over literacy and education is still happening in the world today.    --Sample essay on Frederick Douglass’s Narrative of the Life of Frederick Douglass, an American Slave  Select one: a.

                            22. Spot the thesis statement in the following passage:
In the 1940s, George Orwell warned “Who controls the past controls the future. Who controls the present controls the past” (Orwell 30). In the 1990s a band called Rage Against the Machine, the name itself referring to a people’s movement to fight against control (corporation, government or otherwise) used this mantra in their song “Testify,” a warning to not silently endure oppression. This warning is not only relevant to the 20th century, but has been applicable since human beings started forming structures of power to control and oppress one another. This can vividly be seen during the times of slavery in the United States when blacks were enslaved for two and a half centuries. In Frederick Douglass’s novel Narrative of the Life of Frederick Douglass, an American Slave, Douglass reveals how this long and brutal control of human beings was partly accomplished through control over literacy. The control and limitations over reading and writing during slavery sought to make slaves like Douglass ignorant, powerless, and therefore more easily controlled, and this control over literacy and education is still happening in the world today.
