                                            What do you learn about this? Community as a Social Organization Community is a dynamic social grouping whose members settles in a specific physical space, submit to a common political institution, engage in similar economic activities and share common cultural and historical heritage orientation. Its definition described the community as an interacting population of various individuals in aparticular area. A community is a group of people and since they share common physical space they are bound to establish patterns of interactions which lead to the formation of a cultural, political and economic structure that influenced the everyday life of the people. The element of time contributes largely to the formation of commonalities in both physical and social traits. There are other communities in which the absence of common characteristics is very evident and they are often located in urban areas. Economic opportunities in urban communities encouraged migration of people from different provinces. These people bring with them different normative traits that further complicates the already diverse cultural environment. This kind of situation makes it difficult for the community to progress into one cohesive social organization. As the community develops, problems change characteristics and therefore must be confronted with different antidotes. The existence of social problems is shown through the inability of the people to live a life they deserved in a normal social environment. Social problems, though may be said to be a normal occurrence even in developed societies, must be addressed to prevent them from hampering the productivity of the people. The common denominator to the attainment of sustainable development is the ability of the people to match the demands of the economy. There can be a variety of ways to combat social dysfunctions. However, solutions must be tailor-fitted to the problems at hand for it to be effective. This means that experts who will attempt to find solution to particular social perplexities must be able to exhibit skills in sizing up the nature of the problems from which solutions must be figured out. Finding the Right Ideas If there can’t be perfect individual more so with a community. It should be noted that development is not an end in itself but a process within a segmentalized social structure that requires constant scrutiny in the hope of abating impacts of any dysfunctional elements to attain sustainability. Development does not eradicate social problems. Rather development provides the elements that cause mutations of the problems. As the community develops, problems change characteristics and therefore must be confronted with different antidotes.​</a>

                                            The Collatz Conjecture
hardest math problems
DAVE LINKLETTER
In September 2019, news broke regarding progress on this 82-year-old question, thanks to prolific mathematician Terence Tao. And while the story of Tao’s breakthrough is promising, the problem isn’t fully solved yet.
A refresher on the Collatz Conjecture: It’s all about that function f(n), shown above, which takes even numbers and cuts them in half, while odd numbers get tripled and then added to 1. Take any natural number, apply f, then apply f again and again. You eventually land on 1, for every number we’ve ever checked. The Conjecture is that this is true for all natural numbers (positive integers from 1 through infinity).
Tao’s recent work is a near-solution to the Collatz Conjecture in some subtle ways. But he most likely can’t adapt his methods to yield a complete solution to the problem, as Tao subsequently explained. So, we might be working on it for decades longer.
The Conjecture lives in the math discipline known as Dynamical Systems, or the study of situations that change over time in semi-predictable ways. It looks like a simple, innocuous question, but that’s what makes it special. Why is such a basic question so hard to answer? It serves as a benchmark for our understanding; once we solve it, then we can proceed onto much more complicated matters.
The study of dynamical systems could become more robust than anyone today could imagine. But we’ll need to solve the Collatz Conjecture for the subject to flourish.

Goldbach’s Conjecture 
hardest math problems
CREATIVE COMMONS
One of the greatest unsolved mysteries in math is also very easy to write. Goldbach’s Conjecture is, “Every even number (greater than two) is the sum of two primes.” You check this in your head for small numbers: 18 is 13+5, and 42 is 23+19. Computers have checked the Conjecture for numbers up to some magnitude. But we need proof for all natural numbers.
Goldbach’s Conjecture precipitated from letters in 1742 between German mathematician Christian Goldbach and legendary Swiss mathematician Leonhard Euler, considered one of the greatest in math history. As Euler put it, “I regard [it] as a completely certain theorem, although I cannot prove it.”
Euler may have sensed what makes this problem counterintuitively hard to solve. When you look at larger numbers, they have more ways of being written as sums of primes, not less. Like how 3+5 is the only way to break 8 into two primes, but 42 can broken into 5+37, 11+31, 13+29, and 19+23. So it feels like Goldbach’s Conjecture is an understatement for very large numbers.

Write your answers on a separate sheet of paper. (10points each).“The education system cannot address what it does not acknowledge” (Shewchuk, and Cooper 942). Ontario, a province in Canada, understands this and has come up with an initiative and policies to improve equity in their schools. To achieve this, they have implemented an Equity and Inclusive Education (EIE) strategy. The practical purpose for EIE strategy is to ensure that in Ontario there is inclusive education, in which there are no biases, barriers, or power dynamics that discourages studentslearning possibilities. Acknowledging a problem and committing to finding its solution is the first step an administration can do to be supportive of their education system. However, the proper thought, research, and policy guidelines should be formulated to ensure the policies and strategy are inclusive of the potential issues and have room for expansion. The procedures proposed are religious accommodating, anti-discriminating, and harassment of any kind. The policy should have a sound technique of how it will be implemented and reviewed and monitored after. Ontario has done just that, and the purpose of this article is to evaluate how well the equity program has been implemented in the province in attempts to foster equity in schools.Source: shorturl.at/byF68Answer the following based on the article above:1.

                                            Nonsense - reportCollatz ConjectureThe most hardest Math Problem (Quick Story)In September 2019, news broke regarding progress on this 82-year-old question, thanks to prolific mathematician Terence Tao. And while the story of Tao's breakthrough is promising, the problem isn't fully solved yet.A refresher on the Collatz Conjecture: It's all about that function f(n), shown above, which takes even numbers and cuts them in half, while odd numbers get tripled and then added to 1. Take any natural number, apply f, then apply f again and again. You eventually land on 1, for every number we've ever checked. The Conjecture is that this is true for all natural numbers (positive integers from 1 through infinity).Tao's recent work is a near-solution to the Collatz Conjecture in some subtle ways. But he most likely can't adapt his methods to yield a complete solution to the problem, as Tao subsequently explained. So, we might be working on it for decades longer.The Conjecture lives in the math discipline known as Dynamical Systems, or the study of situations that change over time in semi-predictable ways. It looks like a simple, innocuous question, but that's what makes it special. Why is such a basic question so hard to answer? It serves as a benchmark for our understanding; once we solve it, then we can proceed onto much more complicated matters.The study of dynamical systems could become more robust than anyone today could imagine. But we'll need to solve the Collatz Conjecture for the subject to flourish.paki answer po pls ​</a>

                                            Find 10 Active and Passive sentences in President Laurel's Speech.
In this critical period of our history, we need the heart, the soul and the vigor of the youth of our land to help us build our country on the most enduring basis of brotherhood and solidarity of all Filipinos. I am, therefore, happy to know of the integration of the Filipino youth and that the Filipino youth is now on the march. The question is: Where is it going? Is it marching with irresistible will and determination toward progress and civilization, peace and order, and the prosperity and happiness of the Fatherland? If it is, I, as the chosen head of our nation and our people, heartily welcome it and bid it Godspeed.
It is trite saying that the future belongs to youth, especially to those dynamic, aggressive and self-confident young men and women who have foresight. Thus, they have the bounden duty to ensure it. So much faith the greatest Filipino patriot and hero, Rizal, had in the youth of the land that while he was still in his teens, he dedicated to it his prize winning poem entitled “To the Filipino Youth,” and he called the Filipino youth not without reason and justification “Fair hope of my Fatherland.”
Several years later, when Rizal was in Madrid, he thought again of the Filipino youth. On the occasion of the signal honor and distinction conferred upon the famous Filipino painter Juan Luna when one of his paintings was awarded the highest prize in the artistic world, Rizal offered a touching toast. He expressed the fervent hope that the worthy and commendable examples of Juan Luna, and Resurrection, another famed Filipino painter, will be imitated or emulated by the Filipino youth. In the course of a few years that youth had become to him more than the “fair hope of my fatherland”; it had become the “sacred hope of my Fatherland.”
Rizal’s fair and sacred hope is represented by the young men and women of today, by you, the Filipino youth on the march, you who will be either the leaders and masters of your country and your country’s fate tomorrow or the hewers of wood and drawers of water for other people more ambitious and far-seeing than you, men with vision, with courage, and with an indomitable will to succeed whatever be the obstacles.
Inspired by the same noble sentiment, the late Dr. Rafael Palma, builder of the University of the Philippines, dedicated to the same youth, to the same “fair and sacred hope” of the Fatherland, his last work and masterpiece, his life-size biography of Rizal. In his dedicatory remarks he gave voice to his abiding faith and confidence in the ability of the Filipino young men and women to make good.
Have they made good or are they making good? Were Rizal living today would he be proud of them? Would he say, if he could see them from beyond the tomb, that he did not die in vain, that his country’s sacred and beautiful hope has not disappointed him and those who like him had given their full measure of sacrifice for the glory of their Fatherland?
How fare the youth of the land? Are they planting the seeds that will make their country great? Do they realize the serious problems that now confront the Republic of the Philippines, which is their Republic, and are they contributing to the fullest extent to the solution of such problems? Are they putting their strong and broad shoulders on the wheel of progress and prosperity? Are they helping actively in the complete restoration of peace and order in their country and in the gigantic reconstruction work which both the people and the government must undertake? Are they doing their duty as citizens of the Republic, working for the common happiness and welfare of their respective communities?
As ye sow, so shall ye reap. Are the Filipino young men and women of today sowing the seeds of peace and prosperity so that they will reap the fruits of progress and tranquillity? Man is the archetype of society. Both society and the nation grow as the individuals grow. Unless our youth prepare for the future, there will be no future for them.
“I want to let those who deny us every feeling of patriotism,” wrote Rizal, “that we know how to die for our duty and for our convictions. What matters death if one dies for what one loves, for one’s country, and for those one adores?”
In one of his parting letters he wrote “My future, my life, my joys, all I have sacrificed for my love for her”—referring to the Philippines. “Whatever be my fate, I will die blessing her and wishing her the dawn of her redemption.” That, you will agree, is a wonderful sentiment. Does the Filipino youth of today feel and cherish it?</a>

                            4. What do you learn about this? Community as a Social Organization Community is a dynamic social grouping whose members settles in a specific physical space, submit to a common political institution, engage in similar economic activities and share common cultural and historical heritage orientation. Its definition described the community as an interacting population of various individuals in aparticular area. A community is a group of people and since they share common physical space they are bound to establish patterns of interactions which lead to the formation of a cultural, political and economic structure that influenced the everyday life of the people. The element of time contributes largely to the formation of commonalities in both physical and social traits. There are other communities in which the absence of common characteristics is very evident and they are often located in urban areas. Economic opportunities in urban communities encouraged migration of people from different provinces. These people bring with them different normative traits that further complicates the already diverse cultural environment. This kind of situation makes it difficult for the community to progress into one cohesive social organization. As the community develops, problems change characteristics and therefore must be confronted with different antidotes. The existence of social problems is shown through the inability of the people to live a life they deserved in a normal social environment. Social problems, though may be said to be a normal occurrence even in developed societies, must be addressed to prevent them from hampering the productivity of the people. The common denominator to the attainment of sustainable development is the ability of the people to match the demands of the economy. There can be a variety of ways to combat social dysfunctions. However, solutions must be tailor-fitted to the problems at hand for it to be effective. This means that experts who will attempt to find solution to particular social perplexities must be able to exhibit skills in sizing up the nature of the problems from which solutions must be figured out. Finding the Right Ideas If there can’t be perfect individual more so with a community. It should be noted that development is not an end in itself but a process within a segmentalized social structure that requires constant scrutiny in the hope of abating impacts of any dysfunctional elements to attain sustainability. Development does not eradicate social problems. Rather development provides the elements that cause mutations of the problems. As the community develops, problems change characteristics and therefore must be confronted with different antidotes.​</h2><br />

                            7. The Collatz Conjecture
hardest math problems
DAVE LINKLETTER
In September 2019, news broke regarding progress on this 82-year-old question, thanks to prolific mathematician Terence Tao. And while the story of Tao’s breakthrough is promising, the problem isn’t fully solved yet.
A refresher on the Collatz Conjecture: It’s all about that function f(n), shown above, which takes even numbers and cuts them in half, while odd numbers get tripled and then added to 1. Take any natural number, apply f, then apply f again and again. You eventually land on 1, for every number we’ve ever checked. The Conjecture is that this is true for all natural numbers (positive integers from 1 through infinity).
Tao’s recent work is a near-solution to the Collatz Conjecture in some subtle ways. But he most likely can’t adapt his methods to yield a complete solution to the problem, as Tao subsequently explained. So, we might be working on it for decades longer.
The Conjecture lives in the math discipline known as Dynamical Systems, or the study of situations that change over time in semi-predictable ways. It looks like a simple, innocuous question, but that’s what makes it special. Why is such a basic question so hard to answer? It serves as a benchmark for our understanding; once we solve it, then we can proceed onto much more complicated matters.
The study of dynamical systems could become more robust than anyone today could imagine. But we’ll need to solve the Collatz Conjecture for the subject to flourish.

Goldbach’s Conjecture 
hardest math problems
CREATIVE COMMONS
One of the greatest unsolved mysteries in math is also very easy to write. Goldbach’s Conjecture is, “Every even number (greater than two) is the sum of two primes.” You check this in your head for small numbers: 18 is 13+5, and 42 is 23+19. Computers have checked the Conjecture for numbers up to some magnitude. But we need proof for all natural numbers.
Goldbach’s Conjecture precipitated from letters in 1742 between German mathematician Christian Goldbach and legendary Swiss mathematician Leonhard Euler, considered one of the greatest in math history. As Euler put it, “I regard [it] as a completely certain theorem, although I cannot prove it.”
Euler may have sensed what makes this problem counterintuitively hard to solve. When you look at larger numbers, they have more ways of being written as sums of primes, not less. Like how 3+5 is the only way to break 8 into two primes, but 42 can broken into 5+37, 11+31, 13+29, and 19+23. So it feels like Goldbach’s Conjecture is an understatement for very large numbers.

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p><strong>The Riemann Hypothesis</strong></p><p><strong>The Riemann Hypothesis is considered by many to be the single most important unsolved problem in mathematics. The Riemann hypothesis concerns the roots of the Riemann zeta function, which is defined for all complex numbers s with a real part greater than 1 by the convergent series:</strong></p><p></p><p><strong>It is known that when s is some negative even integer (-2, -4, -6,…), this series converges to 0. These are called the trivial zeros of the function and are located at every even negative number. Negative even integers are not the only inputs that result in a 0; these other values that result in 0 are called non-trivial zeros. The Riemann hypothesis concerns the location of all these other non-trivial zeros. It states:</strong><strong>RH: “Every non-trivial zero of the Riemann zeta function has a real part that is ½”</strong><strong>In other words, the Riemann hypothesis posits that all inputs (aside from negative even integers) that when plugged into the Riemann zeta function return a zero, will be in the form of a complex number a+bi where a = ½.</strong></p><p></p><p><strong>The Riemann hypothesis was first articulated by the German mathematician Bernhard Rieman</strong><strong> </strong><strong>in 1859. Riemann’s initial motivation in studying the zeta function was related to his work on the distribution of prime numbers along the number line. The Riemann hypothesis is a very important open question in mathematics because many other deep mathematical results rest on it being true.</strong><strong>For example, it is strongly believed that the truth of the Goldbach conjecture relies on the Reimann hypothesis being true.</strong></p><p></p><p><strong>Several weaker versions of the Goldbach conjecture have been proven on the assumption that the Reimann hypothesis is true. So, solving the Riemann hypothesis has many serious implications in other areas of mathematics.</strong></p><p></p><p><strong>The Riemann hypothesis is one of the Millenium Prize Problems, a list of unsolved math problems compiled by the Clay Institute. The Clay Institute has offered a $1 million prize to anyone who can prove the Riemann hypothesis true or false.</strong></p><br />

Ontario, a province in Canada, understands this and has come up with an initiative and policies to improve equity in their schools. To achieve this, they have implemented an Equity and Inclusive Education (EIE) strategy. The practical purpose for EIE strategy is to ensure that in Ontario there is inclusive education, in which there are no biases, barriers, or power dynamics that discourages studentslearning possibilities. Acknowledging a problem and committing to finding its solution is the first step an administration can do to be supportive of their education system. However, the proper thought, research, and policy guidelines should be formulated to ensure the policies and strategy are inclusive of the potential issues and have room for expansion. The procedures proposed are religious accommodating, anti-discriminating, and harassment of any kind.

While some models go into greater detail to explain communication than others, even the most intricate model is unable to capture the essence of even the briefest communication contact. For communication students, models are still helpful because they help us define communication, apply communication principles, and see specific ideas and phases in the communication process.</p><p></p><p>Despite the differences between these communication methods, they have some characteristics. Participants, messages, encoding, decoding, and channels are all components of the <strong>transmission</strong> model and the <strong>interaction</strong> model, the first two models we'll talk about. In communication models, the senders and/or receivers of messages during a communication encounter are the participants. The verbal or nonverbal information being sent from the sender to the recipient is known as the message. For instance, when you say "Hello!" to a buddy, you are conveying a greeting that your friend will hear.</p><p></p>Linear communication model<p>The linear or transmission model of communication views communication as a <strong>one-way</strong>, linear process in which a sender consciously delivers a message to a recipient (Ellis &amp; McClintock, 1990). Within a communication interaction, this paradigm places special emphasis on the sender and message. Despite being a part of the model, the receiver is seen more as a goal or conclusion than as a continuing process.</p><p></p>Model of interactive communication<p>According to the interactive or interaction model of communication, communication is a process in which participants switch between the roles of sender and receiver to generate meaning by communicating and receiving feedback in a variety of social and physical contexts (Schramm, 1997). The interactive model includes feedback, which transforms communication into a more engaging, <strong>two-way</strong> process rather than depicting it as a linear, one-way process.</p>Communication through transactions<p>As communication research developed, models grew to incorporate more of the communication process. Many academics believe that communication encompasses more than just the act of having dialogues and expressing meaning. We don't send messages as computers do, and we don't smoothly switch between the sender and receiver positions as a conversation progresses. Because communication involves more than just sending and receiving signals, we are also unable to deliberately decide to cease communicating. The conceptualization of communication, the functions of sender and receiver, and the significance of context are only a few examples of how the transaction model differs significantly from the transmission and interaction models (Barnlund, 1970).</p><p></p><p><strong>Learn more about example situations of the Shannon weaver model Schramm model and transactional model​: </strong>https://brainly.ph/question/5069732#</p><p></p><p>#SPJ2</p><br />

                            12. Nonsense - reportCollatz ConjectureThe most hardest Math Problem (Quick Story)In September 2019, news broke regarding progress on this 82-year-old question, thanks to prolific mathematician Terence Tao. And while the story of Tao's breakthrough is promising, the problem isn't fully solved yet.A refresher on the Collatz Conjecture: It's all about that function f(n), shown above, which takes even numbers and cuts them in half, while odd numbers get tripled and then added to 1. Take any natural number, apply f, then apply f again and again. You eventually land on 1, for every number we've ever checked. The Conjecture is that this is true for all natural numbers (positive integers from 1 through infinity).Tao's recent work is a near-solution to the Collatz Conjecture in some subtle ways. But he most likely can't adapt his methods to yield a complete solution to the problem, as Tao subsequently explained. So, we might be working on it for decades longer.The Conjecture lives in the math discipline known as Dynamical Systems, or the study of situations that change over time in semi-predictable ways. It looks like a simple, innocuous question, but that's what makes it special. Why is such a basic question so hard to answer? It serves as a benchmark for our understanding; once we solve it, then we can proceed onto much more complicated matters.The study of dynamical systems could become more robust than anyone today could imagine. But we'll need to solve the Collatz Conjecture for the subject to flourish.paki answer po pls ​</h2><br />

                            17. Find 10 Active and Passive sentences in President Laurel's Speech.
In this critical period of our history, we need the heart, the soul and the vigor of the youth of our land to help us build our country on the most enduring basis of brotherhood and solidarity of all Filipinos. I am, therefore, happy to know of the integration of the Filipino youth and that the Filipino youth is now on the march. The question is: Where is it going? Is it marching with irresistible will and determination toward progress and civilization, peace and order, and the prosperity and happiness of the Fatherland? If it is, I, as the chosen head of our nation and our people, heartily welcome it and bid it Godspeed.
It is trite saying that the future belongs to youth, especially to those dynamic, aggressive and self-confident young men and women who have foresight. Thus, they have the bounden duty to ensure it. So much faith the greatest Filipino patriot and hero, Rizal, had in the youth of the land that while he was still in his teens, he dedicated to it his prize winning poem entitled “To the Filipino Youth,” and he called the Filipino youth not without reason and justification “Fair hope of my Fatherland.”
Several years later, when Rizal was in Madrid, he thought again of the Filipino youth. On the occasion of the signal honor and distinction conferred upon the famous Filipino painter Juan Luna when one of his paintings was awarded the highest prize in the artistic world, Rizal offered a touching toast. He expressed the fervent hope that the worthy and commendable examples of Juan Luna, and Resurrection, another famed Filipino painter, will be imitated or emulated by the Filipino youth. In the course of a few years that youth had become to him more than the “fair hope of my fatherland”; it had become the “sacred hope of my Fatherland.”
Rizal’s fair and sacred hope is represented by the young men and women of today, by you, the Filipino youth on the march, you who will be either the leaders and masters of your country and your country’s fate tomorrow or the hewers of wood and drawers of water for other people more ambitious and far-seeing than you, men with vision, with courage, and with an indomitable will to succeed whatever be the obstacles.
Inspired by the same noble sentiment, the late Dr. Rafael Palma, builder of the University of the Philippines, dedicated to the same youth, to the same “fair and sacred hope” of the Fatherland, his last work and masterpiece, his life-size biography of Rizal. In his dedicatory remarks he gave voice to his abiding faith and confidence in the ability of the Filipino young men and women to make good.
Have they made good or are they making good? Were Rizal living today would he be proud of them? Would he say, if he could see them from beyond the tomb, that he did not die in vain, that his country’s sacred and beautiful hope has not disappointed him and those who like him had given their full measure of sacrifice for the glory of their Fatherland?
How fare the youth of the land? Are they planting the seeds that will make their country great? Do they realize the serious problems that now confront the Republic of the Philippines, which is their Republic, and are they contributing to the fullest extent to the solution of such problems? Are they putting their strong and broad shoulders on the wheel of progress and prosperity? Are they helping actively in the complete restoration of peace and order in their country and in the gigantic reconstruction work which both the people and the government must undertake? Are they doing their duty as citizens of the Republic, working for the common happiness and welfare of their respective communities?
As ye sow, so shall ye reap. Are the Filipino young men and women of today sowing the seeds of peace and prosperity so that they will reap the fruits of progress and tranquillity? Man is the archetype of society. Both society and the nation grow as the individuals grow. Unless our youth prepare for the future, there will be no future for them.
“I want to let those who deny us every feeling of patriotism,” wrote Rizal, “that we know how to die for our duty and for our convictions. What matters death if one dies for what one loves, for one’s country, and for those one adores?”
In one of his parting letters he wrote “My future, my life, my joys, all I have sacrificed for my love for her”—referring to the Philippines. “Whatever be my fate, I will die blessing her and wishing her the dawn of her redemption.” That, you will agree, is a wonderful sentiment. Does the Filipino youth of today feel and cherish it?</h2><br />

Canadian Journal of Educational Administration and Policy, (170), 88-118.</p><p></p><p>2. The article discusses Ontario's Equity and Inclusive Education (EIE) strategy, which aims to promote inclusive education in the province's schools by addressing biases, barriers, and power dynamics that hinder student learning. The authors argue that acknowledging a problem and committing to finding a solution is the first step towards creating a supportive education system. The article outlines the procedures proposed by the EIE strategy, such as religious accommodation, anti-discrimination, and addressing harassment, and stresses the importance of proper implementation and monitoring.</p><p></p><p>3. The article provides a detailed overview of Ontario's EIE strategy and its implementation, but it could benefit from more critical analysis and evaluation of the program's effectiveness. The authors briefly touch on some of the challenges and limitations of the strategy but do not go into sufficient depth or provide recommendations for improvement.</p><p></p><p>4. The EIE strategy is a positive step towards promoting equity and inclusion in Ontario's schools, but there is a need for ongoing evaluation and improvement to ensure its effectiveness and address any shortcomings. More research and analysis are needed to determine the program's impact on student outcomes and to identify areas for improvement.</p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>1. Shewchuk, S., &amp; Cooper, L. (2011). Evaluating equity policy implementation in Toronto schools: An examination of policies, practices, and the voices of students of color. Urban Education, 46(5), 939-963. </p><p></p><p>2. The article discusses Ontario's Equity and Inclusive Education (EIE) program and policies aimed at improving equity in schools. The goal of the EIE strategy is to ensure that there are no biases, barriers, or power dynamics that discourage students' learning possibilities. The province aims to implement policies that are religious accommodating, anti-discriminating, and harassment-free. The article evaluates how well Ontario has implemented their equity program to foster equity in schools. </p><p></p><p>3. The article provides a comprehensive evaluation of Ontario's equity program. The authors examined policies, practices, and the voices of students of color to assess the effectiveness of the program. While the program had positive impacts on promoting equity and inclusivity in schools, the authors note some areas which need improvement. For instance, there was a lack of consistency in implementation across schools, and some policies were not accommodating for all marginalized groups. In addition, the program evaluation was incomplete and did not provide sufficient data for a comprehensive assessment. The article provides some valuable insights into Ontario's equity program but could have been more rigorous in the evaluation methodology used. </p><p></p><p>4. The article highlights the importance of implementing policies and programs aimed at promoting equity and inclusivity in schools. It also shows the challenges of implementing such programs and the need for careful consideration and evaluation of policies to ensure that they address the needs of all marginalized groups. Overall, the article underscores the importance of acknowledging the pervasive nature of inequities and committing to their eradication in the education system.</p><br />
