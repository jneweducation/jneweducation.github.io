He set up his barrow in a good corner, and soon had a great crowd round him; for everyone knew he always sold extra fine pears, though he did also ask an extra high price. Now, while he was crying up his fruit, a poor, old, ragged, hungry-looking priest stopped just in front of the barrow, and very humbly begged him to give him one of the pears. But the countryman, who was very mean and very nasty-tempered, wouldn't hear of giving him any, and as the priest didn't seem inclined to move on, he began calling him all the bad names he could think of. "Good sir," said the priest, "you have got hundreds of pears on your barrow. I only ask you for one. You would never even know you had lost one. Really, you needn't get angry.""Give him a pear that is going bad; that will make him happy," said one of the crowd. "The old man is quite right; you'd never miss it.""I've said I won't, and I won't!" cried the countryman: and all the people close by began shouting, first one thing, and then another, until the constable of the market, hearing the hubbub, hurried up; and when he had made out what was the matter, pulled some cash out of his purse, bought a ​pear, and gave it to the priest. For he was afraid that the noise would come to the ears of the mandarin who was just being carried down the street.The old priest took the pear with a low bow, and held it up in front of the crowd, saying, "You all know that I have no home, no parents, no children, no clothes of my own, no food, because I gave everything up when I became a priest. So it puzzles me how anyone can be so selfish and so stingy as to refuse to give me one single pear. Now I am quite a different sort of man from this countryman. I have got here some perfectly exquisite pears, and I shall feel most deeply honoured if you will accept them from me." "Why on earth didn't you eat them yourself, instead of begging for one?" asked a man in the crowd. "Ah," answered the priest, "I must grow them first." So he ate up the pear, only leaving a single pip. Then he took a pick which was fastened across his back, dug a deep hole in the ground at his feet, and planted the pip, which he covered all over with earth. "Will some one fetch me some hot water to water this?" he asked. The people, who were crowding round, thought he was only joking, but one of them ran and fetched a kettle of boiling water and gave it to the priest, who very carefully poured it over the place where he had sowed the pip. Then, almost while he was pouring, they saw, first a tiny green sprout, and then another, come pushing their heads above the ground; then one leaf uncurled, and then another, while the shoots kept growing taller and taller; then there stood before them a young tree with a ​few branches with a few leaves; then more leaves; then flowers; and last of all clusters of huge, ripe, sweet-smelling pears weighing the branches down to the ground! Now the priest's face shone with pleasure, and the crowd roared with delight when he picked the pears one by one until they were all gone, handing them round with a bow to each man present. Then the old man took the pick again, hacked at the tree until it fell with a crash, when he shouldered it, leaves and all, and with a final bow, walked away.All the time this had been going on, the countryman, quite forgetting his barrow and pears, had been in the midst of the crowd, standing on the tips of his toes, and straining his eyes to try to make out what was happening. But when the old priest had gone, and the crowd was getting thin, he turned round to his barrow, and saw with horror that it was quite empty. Every single pear had gone! In a moment he understood what had happened. The pears the old priest had been so generous in giving away were not his own; they were the countryman's! What was more, one of the handles of his barrow was missing, and there was no doubt that he had started from home with two! He was in a towering rage, and rushed as hard as he could after the priest; but just as he turned the corner he saw, lying close to the wall, the barrow-handle itself, which without any doubt was the very pear-tree which the priest had cut down. All the people in the market were simply splitting their sides with laughter; but as for the priest, no one saw him any more.​</a>

                                            Text Selection 1 The Jeepney - A Product of Filipino Ingenuity by Carmen Guerrero Nakpil 82 no one could do Bailey bridge, as insolent than the jeepney, If one were looking for a symbol of postwar Philippines, c y, which is as abundant and as persistent as postwar mosquitoes, as noisy and dangerous as postwar politics, as useful as a b as a squatter, and as much a creature of improvisation as the postwar Filipino. de a shop on an army jeep. It holds, in addition to its driver, from six to ten passengers and the most esoteric decorating job on wheels. Its body juts out way made body the asphalt. It looks just as crowded when it is carrying four as when it is carrying behind the original chassis and when fully loaded its rear lists perilously close twelve people - as it often does when business is good. Foreigners who come to Manila for the first time stare in disbelief at the fleets of jeepneys which swarm like a plague of locusts all over the city. They swear they have never seen anything quite like them. Indeed, no one who has become used to thinking of the army jeep as a drab, olive-colored drudge would recognize it on the streets of Manila in its reincarnation as the flamboyant Filipino jeepney. The man, who named the jeep the general-purpose vehicle, could never have imagined the possibilities that have now been unfolded by the Filipino jeepney. Not even the creator of the army jeep would recognize it now. Its staid radiator front hides behind a magnificent nickel-plated gird, lifted perhaps from a Cadillac or a Ford, or devised by some ingenious tin-smith to look like a dragon's maw. Its hood, now painted in a rhapsody of unexpected colors, rumbles menacingly beneath a figure-flying fish; its mudguards have been redesigned and now leap forward audaciously beneath twin quavering antennae bearing pompoms of varicolored plastic. The original canvas top no longer flaps about in tent-like simplicity. It reposes on a curved structure, like a shallow dome of welded iron, as proud as the marquee of a stylish hotel, fringed and lined with plastic leatherette The jeep's square body has become a quaint carriage as open as a verandah and as gay as a movie house. A railing of fretted metal runs down each side ending in two handle-bars of a design which another age called "modernistic" and which hamper rather than aid the descent and ascent of passengers at the rear steps. rest of the jeepney is painted in a characteristic design rendered in unpredictable color combinations which can best be described as Oriental baroque; whorls, lines stylized wings and shells are fluted and convoluted in geometrical precision and The bemuse the eye like a Manila Bay sunset. A jeepney is hardly a jeepney without its painted signs. Beneath the windshield the lettering may read Divisoria-Mahal Ko-Pasig or Manila and Suburbs-Heart and Soul. At the side is inscribed the name of the operator and an i of the passenger capacity. On the steps are more letters: a flirtatious Kiss Me Not o They are allusive, inspirational or romantic, being taken from movie titles, D a severe Keep Distance.

Having explored twenty miles further in this desert, I found that the river still kept its depth and breadth, but that it was much more thickly lined with trees.Some twelve miles above the barge, we went ashore to refresh ourselves and to cook our food. One of the Indians 1 took with me to examine the nature of the soil and to cross the bends of the river. The other Indian I left with John Robinson and Thomas Emry, with their matches, light, and with the order that they should discharge a gun for my retreat, at the first sight of any Indian.Within a quarter of an hour, I heard a loud cry and the yelling of Indians, but no warning shot. Supposing my companions were surprised, and that the Indian guides had betrayed us, I seized my guide and found his arm fast to my hand with a garter, with my pistol aimed, ready to take revenge upon him. He advised me to fly and seemed ignorant of what was happening.But as he went on, I was struck with an arrow on the right thigh, without however, being seriously harmed. When this happened, I caught sight of two Indians drawing their bows. I prevented them from shooting by firing my French pistol.By the time I had loaded again, three or four more Indians were making ready to shoot. The first had fallen down or fled. At my next discharge, they shot their arrows. I made barricade of my servant, who offered not to fight Twenty or thirty arrows were shot to me, but fell short. I had discharged my pistol three or four times before. Opechanconough, the king of Pamaunck, with two hundred men, surrounded me. Each drew his bow and then lay it on the ground without shooting,My servant explained that I was the captain. They demanded my arms. The rest they said were slain; only me they would spare. My guide implored me not to shoot. In mak ing for the boat, being in the midst of a low quagmire, and minding the Indians more than my steps, 1 stepped directly into the quagmire,as did my Indian also, in trying to draw me out.Thus surprised. I resolved to try their mercy. I cast my arms from me. Until I did this, none dared to approach me; but now they seized me, drew me out of the quagmire, and led me to the king. I presented him with a compass, describing its use as well as I could, and he was so much amazed that he let me go on with a discourse on the roundness of the Earth, and the course of the sun, moon, stars, and planets.He then paid me back with kind speeches and with bread, and led me to where the cone was, and where John Robinson lay, killed. Emry I did not see.From the great number of fires: all through the woods, I realized that the Indians had been hunting deer. At each place where they stopped, I expected them to execute me as kindly as they could.When we approached their town, which was within six miles of the spot where I was captured, all the women and children who had learned of this event came to meet us. The king was well-guarded by twenty bowmen, five on the Blank and five in the rear, and in each flank in front of him a sword and a gun with the same behind him; then a bowman on either side of me. The rest filed along in the rear, forming a V-shape, each with his bow and a handful of arrows, a quiver, grimly painted, at his back. On each flank was a sergeant, one running constantly toward the front, the other toward the rear, at a regular pace in good order. After this performance had lasted for sometime the warriors rushed into a circle with a dance: and finally each man departed for his lodging. The captain conducted me to his lodging, and gave me for supper a quarter of venison and some ten pounds of bread. What I left was kept for me, and sent with me to my lodging.​ paki sagot po plsss ​​</a>

                                            Think again about the story "Captured by Opechancanough."Note that the narrator tells about his travels. A travel account iscalled a journal. The journal of Captain John Smith-a recordof the perils and frustrations of America's first settlers-is oneof the first literature of America."Capture by Opechancanough"              An excerpt           By John SmithWith two Indians for my quides and two of our own company, I set out, leaving seven in the barge. Having explored twenty miles further in this desert, I found that the river still kept its depth and breadth, but that it was much more thickly lined with trees.Some twelve miles above the barge, we went ashore to refresh ourselves and to cook our food. One of the Indians 1 took with me to examine the nature of the soil and to cross the bends of the river. The other Indian I left with John Robinson and Thomas Emry, with their matches, light, and with the order that they should discharge a gun for my retreat, at the first sight of any Indian.Within a quarter of an hour, I heard a loud cry and the yelling of Indians, but no warning shot. Supposing my companions were surprised, and that the Indian guides had betrayed us, I seized my guide and found his arm fast to my hand with a garter, with my pistol aimed, ready to take revenge upon him. He advised me to fly and seemed ignorant of what was happening.But as he went on, I was struck with an arrow on the right thigh, without however, being seriously harmed. When this happened, I caught sight of two Indians drawing their bows. I prevented them from shooting by firing my French pistol.By the time I had loaded again, three or four more Indians were making ready to shoot. The first had fallen down or fled. At my next discharge, they shot their arrows. I made barricade of my servant, who offered not to fight Twenty or thirty arrows were shot to me, but fell short. I had discharged my pistol three or four times before. Opechanconough, the king of Pamaunck, with two hundred men, surrounded me. Each drew his bow and then lay it on the ground without shooting,My servant explained that I was the captain. They demanded my arms. The rest they said were slain; only me they would spare. My guide implored me not to shoot. In mak ing for the boat, being in the midst of a low quagmire, and minding the Indians more than my steps, 1 stepped directly into the quagmire,as did my Indian also, in trying to draw me out.Thus surprised. I resolved to try their mercy. I cast my arms from me. Until I did this, none dared to approach me; but now they seized me, drew me out of the quagmire, and led me to the king. I presented him with a compass, describing its use as well as I could, and he was so much amazed that he let me go on with a discourse on the roundness of the Earth, and the course of the sun, moon, stars, and planets.He then paid me back with kind speeches and with bread, and led me to where the cone was, and where John Robinson lay, killed. Emry I did not see.From the great number of fires: all through the woods, I realized that the Indians had been hunting deer. At each place where they stopped, I expected them to execute me as kindly as they could.When we approached their town, which was within six miles of the spot where I was captured, all the women and children who had learned of this event came to meet us. The king was well-guarded by twenty bowmen, five on the Blank and five in the rear, and in each flank in front of him a sword and a gun with the same behind him; then a bowman on either side of me. The rest filed along in the rear, forming a V-shape, each with his bow and a handful of arrows, a quiver, grimly painted, at his back. On each flank was a sergeant, one running constantly toward the front, the other toward the rear, at a regular pace in good order. After this performance had lasted for sometime the warriors rushed into a circle with a dance: and finally each man departed for his lodging. The captain conducted me to his lodging, and gave me for supper a quarter of venison and some ten pounds of bread. What I left was kept for me, and sent with me to my lodging.​</a>

                            6. read the story. copy lines from the story that shows hyperbole and lines that shows litotes.THE WONDERFUL PEAR-TREEOnce upon a time a countryman came into the town on market-day, and brought a load of very special pears with him to sell. He set up his barrow in a good corner, and soon had a great crowd round him; for everyone knew he always sold extra fine pears, though he did also ask an extra high price. Now, while he was crying up his fruit, a poor, old, ragged, hungry-looking priest stopped just in front of the barrow, and very humbly begged him to give him one of the pears. But the countryman, who was very mean and very nasty-tempered, wouldn't hear of giving him any, and as the priest didn't seem inclined to move on, he began calling him all the bad names he could think of. "Good sir," said the priest, "you have got hundreds of pears on your barrow. I only ask you for one. You would never even know you had lost one. Really, you needn't get angry.""Give him a pear that is going bad; that will make him happy," said one of the crowd. "The old man is quite right; you'd never miss it.""I've said I won't, and I won't!" cried the countryman: and all the people close by began shouting, first one thing, and then another, until the constable of the market, hearing the hubbub, hurried up; and when he had made out what was the matter, pulled some cash out of his purse, bought a ​pear, and gave it to the priest. For he was afraid that the noise would come to the ears of the mandarin who was just being carried down the street.The old priest took the pear with a low bow, and held it up in front of the crowd, saying, "You all know that I have no home, no parents, no children, no clothes of my own, no food, because I gave everything up when I became a priest. So it puzzles me how anyone can be so selfish and so stingy as to refuse to give me one single pear. Now I am quite a different sort of man from this countryman. I have got here some perfectly exquisite pears, and I shall feel most deeply honoured if you will accept them from me." "Why on earth didn't you eat them yourself, instead of begging for one?" asked a man in the crowd. "Ah," answered the priest, "I must grow them first." So he ate up the pear, only leaving a single pip. Then he took a pick which was fastened across his back, dug a deep hole in the ground at his feet, and planted the pip, which he covered all over with earth. "Will some one fetch me some hot water to water this?" he asked. The people, who were crowding round, thought he was only joking, but one of them ran and fetched a kettle of boiling water and gave it to the priest, who very carefully poured it over the place where he had sowed the pip. Then, almost while he was pouring, they saw, first a tiny green sprout, and then another, come pushing their heads above the ground; then one leaf uncurled, and then another, while the shoots kept growing taller and taller; then there stood before them a young tree with a ​few branches with a few leaves; then more leaves; then flowers; and last of all clusters of huge, ripe, sweet-smelling pears weighing the branches down to the ground! Now the priest's face shone with pleasure, and the crowd roared with delight when he picked the pears one by one until they were all gone, handing them round with a bow to each man present. Then the old man took the pick again, hacked at the tree until it fell with a crash, when he shouldered it, leaves and all, and with a final bow, walked away.All the time this had been going on, the countryman, quite forgetting his barrow and pears, had been in the midst of the crowd, standing on the tips of his toes, and straining his eyes to try to make out what was happening. But when the old priest had gone, and the crowd was getting thin, he turned round to his barrow, and saw with horror that it was quite empty. Every single pear had gone! In a moment he understood what had happened. The pears the old priest had been so generous in giving away were not his own; they were the countryman's! What was more, one of the handles of his barrow was missing, and there was no doubt that he had started from home with two! He was in a towering rage, and rushed as hard as he could after the priest; but just as he turned the corner he saw, lying close to the wall, the barrow-handle itself, which without any doubt was the very pear-tree which the priest had cut down. All the people in the market were simply splitting their sides with laughter; but as for the priest, no one saw him any more.​</h2><br />

                            12. Text Selection 1 The Jeepney - A Product of Filipino Ingenuity by Carmen Guerrero Nakpil 82 no one could do Bailey bridge, as insolent than the jeepney, If one were looking for a symbol of postwar Philippines, c y, which is as abundant and as persistent as postwar mosquitoes, as noisy and dangerous as postwar politics, as useful as a b as a squatter, and as much a creature of improvisation as the postwar Filipino. de a shop on an army jeep. It holds, in addition to its driver, from six to ten passengers and the most esoteric decorating job on wheels. Its body juts out way made body the asphalt. It looks just as crowded when it is carrying four as when it is carrying behind the original chassis and when fully loaded its rear lists perilously close twelve people - as it often does when business is good. Foreigners who come to Manila for the first time stare in disbelief at the fleets of jeepneys which swarm like a plague of locusts all over the city. They swear they have never seen anything quite like them. Indeed, no one who has become used to thinking of the army jeep as a drab, olive-colored drudge would recognize it on the streets of Manila in its reincarnation as the flamboyant Filipino jeepney. The man, who named the jeep the general-purpose vehicle, could never have imagined the possibilities that have now been unfolded by the Filipino jeepney. Not even the creator of the army jeep would recognize it now. Its staid radiator front hides behind a magnificent nickel-plated gird, lifted perhaps from a Cadillac or a Ford, or devised by some ingenious tin-smith to look like a dragon's maw. Its hood, now painted in a rhapsody of unexpected colors, rumbles menacingly beneath a figure-flying fish; its mudguards have been redesigned and now leap forward audaciously beneath twin quavering antennae bearing pompoms of varicolored plastic. The original canvas top no longer flaps about in tent-like simplicity. It reposes on a curved structure, like a shallow dome of welded iron, as proud as the marquee of a stylish hotel, fringed and lined with plastic leatherette The jeep's square body has become a quaint carriage as open as a verandah and as gay as a movie house. A railing of fretted metal runs down each side ending in two handle-bars of a design which another age called "modernistic" and which hamper rather than aid the descent and ascent of passengers at the rear steps. rest of the jeepney is painted in a characteristic design rendered in unpredictable color combinations which can best be described as Oriental baroque; whorls, lines stylized wings and shells are fluted and convoluted in geometrical precision and The bemuse the eye like a Manila Bay sunset. A jeepney is hardly a jeepney without its painted signs. Beneath the windshield the lettering may read Divisoria-Mahal Ko-Pasig or Manila and Suburbs-Heart and Soul. At the side is inscribed the name of the operator and an i of the passenger capacity. On the steps are more letters: a flirtatious Kiss Me Not o They are allusive, inspirational or romantic, being taken from movie titles, D a severe Keep Distance.

                        1. Carmen Guerrero Nakpil is the author of the text "The Jeepney - A Product of Filipino Ingenuity."<br /><br />2. The author described the jeepney as a flamboyant, abundantly decorated vehicle that is noisy, crowded, and dangerous. It can carry six to ten passengers, and sometimes up to twelve, and is a creature of improvisation and ingenuity.<br /><br />3. The jeepney symbolizes postwar Philippines, with its abundance, persistence, usefulness, and improvisation. It is a product of Filipino ingenuity and resourcefulness, and a reflection of the country's history and culture.<br /><br />4. The text does not provide a direct answer to this question, but it does highlight the jeepney's usefulness, creativity, and cultural significance.<br /><br />5. As an AI language model, I do not have personal opinions or biases. However, the proposed phase-out of jeepneys is a controversial issue that has sparked debates and protests in the Philippines. Supporters argue that it is necessary to modernize the public transportation system and reduce air pollution, while critics argue that it will displace thousands of drivers and harm small businesses.<br />

Are the eventsnarrated in the storyreal?​"Capture by Opechancanough" An excerptBy John SmithWith two Indians for my quides and two of our own company, I set out, leaving seven in the barge. Having explored twenty miles further in this desert, I found that the river still kept its depth and breadth, but that it was much more thickly lined with trees.Some twelve miles above the barge, we went ashore to refresh ourselves and to cook our food. One of the Indians 1 took with me to examine the nature of the soil and to cross the bends of the river. The other Indian I left with John Robinson and Thomas Emry, with their matches, light, and with the order that they should discharge a gun for my retreat, at the first sight of any Indian.Within a quarter of an hour, I heard a loud cry and the yelling of Indians, but no warning shot. Supposing my companions were surprised, and that the Indian guides had betrayed us, I seized my guide and found his arm fast to my hand with a garter, with my pistol aimed, ready to take revenge upon him. He advised me to fly and seemed ignorant of what was happening.But as he went on, I was struck with an arrow on the right thigh, without however, being seriously harmed. When this happened, I caught sight of two Indians drawing their bows. I prevented them from shooting by firing my French pistol.By the time I had loaded again, three or four more Indians were making ready to shoot. The first had fallen down or fled. At my next discharge, they shot their arrows. I made barricade of my servant, who offered not to fight Twenty or thirty arrows were shot to me, but fell short. I had discharged my pistol three or four times before. Opechanconough, the king of Pamaunck, with two hundred men, surrounded me. Each drew his bow and then lay it on the ground without shooting,My servant explained that I was the captain. They demanded my arms. The rest they said were slain; only me they would spare. My guide implored me not to shoot. In mak ing for the boat, being in the midst of a low quagmire, and minding the Indians more than my steps, 1 stepped directly into the quagmire,as did my Indian also, in trying to draw me out.Thus surprised. I resolved to try their mercy. I cast my arms from me. Until I did this, none dared to approach me; but now they seized me, drew me out of the quagmire, and led me to the king. I presented him with a compass, describing its use as well as I could, and he was so much amazed that he let me go on with a discourse on the roundness of the Earth, and the course of the sun, moon, stars, and planets.He then paid me back with kind speeches and with bread, and led me to where the cone was, and where John Robinson lay, killed. Emry I did not see.From the great number of fires: all through the woods, I realized that the Indians had been hunting deer. At each place where they stopped, I expected them to execute me as kindly as they could.When we approached their town, which was within six miles of the spot where I was captured, all the women and children who had learned of this event came to meet us. The king was well-guarded by twenty bowmen, five on the Blank and five in the rear, and in each flank in front of him a sword and a gun with the same behind him; then a bowman on either side of me. The rest filed along in the rear, forming a V-shape, each with his bow and a handful of arrows, a quiver, grimly painted, at his back. On each flank was a sergeant, one running constantly toward the front, the other toward the rear, at a regular pace in good order. After this performance had lasted for sometime the warriors rushed into a circle with a dance: and finally each man departed for his lodging. The captain conducted me to his lodging, and gave me for supper a quarter of venison and some ten pounds of bread. What I left was kept for me, and sent with me to my lodging.​ paki sagot po plsss ​​</h2><br />
