                                            Water, one of the most common substances known to man has become, through the years, a precious commodity. Water is required in practically all facets of human activities. And the need for water is enormous. It is roughly proportional to the population! However, the Philippines is blessed with a large number of rivers, lakes and streams. Thus, the lack of water has never been a real problem. Where an apparent scarcity exists, the difficulty is traceable to the uneven distribution of rainfall necessary to replenish water in rivers, lakes and other bodies of water. Paradoxically, it is sometimes excessive abundance of water that spells trouble. Because of the monsoons, the Philippines has a fairly well-defined wet season. In addition, there are other precipitation-producing weather phenomena: tropical cyclones, thunderstorms, the ITCZ, frontal passages, etc. Singly by themselves, these can generate large amounts of precipitation. In combination with each other or, in particular, with the monsoon, these phenomena are capable of bringing intense and excessive precipitation. Under certain conditions, a surfeit of rainfall results in a potentially disastrous phenomenon - flood. Topic:​</a>

Title: Dear Anonymous, I know you. 
I know you. 
Sitting behind a screen in your room, 
Sipping in the shadows of a coffee shop. 
iPhone, iPad, iAm "Anonymous". 
The most dangerous word you can be labeled, 
The most double-edged of weapons- 
Anonymous. 
You're never really as untraceable 
As the cleared browser history says you are, 
Never as untraceable as the chain of destruction you cause is traceable. 
You're never really as invisible 
As the checked box let's you think you are, 
Never as invisible as the scars you direct a hand to make are visible. 
One word can't be all that. 
Anonymous can't be so dangerous. 
Some clicks on a keyboard can't be so devastating. 
There's a reason it used to be difficult to avoid responsibility. 
Because responsibility for your words, for what you cause, 
Is what allows you to see a few steps ahead. 
Your signature is what allows you to learn from mistakes, 
To vow after you've learned the hard way to think before you act. 
To see that those words have two names attached to them now. 
The writer, and the subject. 
Two traceable, visible people. 
Two hearts beating and breathing, now connected. 
Anonymous constructs a wall between action and reaction. 
It robs you of responsibility. 
Yes, responsibility is a prized possession, there to teach and show. 
Anonymous allows you to settle. 
It robs you of the greater person you could become. 
Yes, your future holds more than this, there beyond the wall of cyber bullying. 
I hate that I was once Anonymous like you. 
I hate that I unknowingly controlled the strings 
Of a self-destructive marionette hand miles away. 
But I don't hate you. Because I know you. 
I know you are more than the mistakes you've made behind that screen. 
I know you are more than Anonymous.

                            9. Water, one of the most common substances known to man has become, through the years, a precious commodity. Water is required in practically all facets of human activities. And the need for water is enormous. It is roughly proportional to the population! However, the Philippines is blessed with a large number of rivers, lakes and streams. Thus, the lack of water has never been a real problem. Where an apparent scarcity exists, the difficulty is traceable to the uneven distribution of rainfall necessary to replenish water in rivers, lakes and other bodies of water. Paradoxically, it is sometimes excessive abundance of water that spells trouble. Because of the monsoons, the Philippines has a fairly well-defined wet season. In addition, there are other precipitation-producing weather phenomena: tropical cyclones, thunderstorms, the ITCZ, frontal passages, etc. Singly by themselves, these can generate large amounts of precipitation. In combination with each other or, in particular, with the monsoon, these phenomena are capable of bringing intense and excessive precipitation. Under certain conditions, a surfeit of rainfall results in a potentially disastrous phenomenon - flood. Topic:​</h2><br />

Title: Dear Anonymous, I know you. 
I know you. 
Sitting behind a screen in your room, 
Sipping in the shadows of a coffee shop. 
iPhone, iPad, iAm "Anonymous". 
The most dangerous word you can be labeled, 
The most double-edged of weapons- 
Anonymous. 
You're never really as untraceable 
As the cleared browser history says you are, 
Never as untraceable as the chain of destruction you cause is traceable. 
You're never really as invisible 
As the checked box let's you think you are, 
Never as invisible as the scars you direct a hand to make are visible. 
One word can't be all that. 
Anonymous can't be so dangerous. 
Some clicks on a keyboard can't be so devastating. 
There's a reason it used to be difficult to avoid responsibility. 
Because responsibility for your words, for what you cause, 
Is what allows you to see a few steps ahead. 
Your signature is what allows you to learn from mistakes, 
To vow after you've learned the hard way to think before you act. 
To see that those words have two names attached to them now. 
The writer, and the subject. 
Two traceable, visible people. 
Two hearts beating and breathing, now connected. 
Anonymous constructs a wall between action and reaction. 
It robs you of responsibility. 
Yes, responsibility is a prized possession, there to teach and show. 
Anonymous allows you to settle. 
It robs you of the greater person you could become. 
Yes, your future holds more than this, there beyond the wall of cyber bullying. 
I hate that I was once Anonymous like you. 
I hate that I unknowingly controlled the strings 
Of a self-destructive marionette hand miles away. 
But I don't hate you. Because I know you. 
I know you are more than the mistakes you've made behind that screen. 
I know you are more than Anonymous.
