                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p></p>principles of trainingIn order to get the maximum out of your training, you need to apply the five key principles of training – specificity, individualisation, progressive overload, variation and be aware of reversibility.The principles of training are the five key areas that you need to focus on and are as follows:1- SPECIFICITY Your training has to be specific to the goal you are setting out the achieve, there is little point in training for a marathon if your goal race is a 5K. The stresses that are applied to the body in training must be the same as those experienced in your chosen sport or adventure, so going back to the point above. Your time is better spent focussing on speed rather than chugging out a 20-mile long run. This principle gets totally disregarded if you are training for general fitness, whereas anything goes!  2- INDVIDUALISATIONThis is a crucial principle, the fundamental fact that everyone is different and not all training is going to be suited for everyone! Different people respond to training in a different way. If you are walking or cycling with a friend, and doing exactly the same amount of training, don’t be concerned if one of you gets fitter faster than the other – this is what individualisation is all about. The same goes for training with someone who is fitter than you, it may come to a point where you are starting to overtake them instead! Lifestyle can play a big part in this, you are going to feel more rested for exercise and able to recover more if you work from home on a laptop, compared to someone who does a lot of hours and manual labour daily with minimal rest. Some days your training can go really well and the next day, even though it was exactly the same length workout, it can be a nightmare. This is what individualisation is all about.3- PROGRESSIVE OVERLOADThis is all about the need to gradually increase the workload that you put your body through. An example of this is in weight training, you wouldn’t stick to the same weight constantly otherwise you won’t make any gains, so you would safely increase the weight to gain strength throughout the weeks. active-adult-body-1032117.jpg It is essential to combine training and rest whilst at the same time increasing the stress that the body is put through. This so-called ‘stress’ is a combination of the frequency, intensity time and type of the workout:FREQUENCY: This is the amount of time you are going to be exercising throughout the week or the number of reps/sets you are going to be doing of a given exercise.INTENSITY: How hard you are going to be pushing is going to determine what kind of session you are going to be doing. If it feels like a 7 on the RPE scale if you are training by effort. TIME: This is how long you are going to be working out for, this again can relate to how long a certain rep is as well as how long you are going to be exercising for as a whole. TYPE: The type of exercise you are going to be doing, dictates what you are going to be training, are you relying on your cardiovascular endurance with a longer run? Or your strength with a weight lifting session?Progression is all about <p></p><br />
