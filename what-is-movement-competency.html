Presenting in front of an audience, no matter how large or small, needs a lot of preparation. Be sure that your multi-media, your notes, your appearance, and over-all presentation are all ready before the day of your presentation2. Start and use too much word fillersa Word fillers are "um", "ah", "okay", "so' or "like", that speakers lost for words or when nervousb Using too much fillers can make a speaker look and sound like he is not confident or prepared enough to deliver himessage3. Overuse a movement or a gesturea Pointing or waving a hand to highlight your point can be overwhelming if used many times. Doing the sagesture may look like a mannerism overtime.b. A nod, a varying tone of voice, standing up straight, walking towards the audience and going back tolecter, enunciating the words clearly and enough softness and loudness of voice can be other forms of gestand movements to help you emphasize a pointLEARNING COMPETENCY WITH CODE:Using the Appropriate Oral Language, Stance and Behavior When SpeakingDIRECTIONS:​</a>

Sound vibrations travel through air, water, and even solid objects, but it’s not possible to see the waves. What if we could see the waves in another way? This science of sound experiment makes sound more visible by forcing objects to react to the sound vibrations. Guide Questions: 1. What happens to the crystals?
