Then, combine the important information from each source to write a 1-paragraph (5-7 sentences only) synthesis. Source # 1: The Neanderthal Man is an ancestor of the modern human. The fossils of the Neanderthals are discovered in a place called Neander Valley in Germany. He is short and stooped with powerful arms. He has a large brain, a low forehead, an extending jaw, and a round chin. All these features make him look more like an ape- man than a real, modern human. When the climate became cold, they lived in caves. They are great hunters: they hunt for animals like bears, foxes, and wild horses for food. They took the skin as clothing and use the bones for tools as jewelry. The Neanderthals are also skilled in making tools: they made choppers, drills, and spears. Scientists also believe that the Neanderthals bury their dead relatives. Source # 2: The Cro-Magnon is one of our ancestors. They lived on Earth after the Neanderthals, another kind of early human, became extinct. The fossils of the Cro- Magnons were discovered by scientists in a village in France. They were six-footers with a wide face, a high forehead, and a square chin. They look very much like us, modern man! They live in caves and hunt wild animals. A study of the caves where they have lived showed drawings of animals and hunters on the cave walls. They also carve animal figures out of stone and put decorations on their weapons. It looks like the Cro-Magnons are very artistic! They also use animal bones as needles, and they sew clothing from animal skin. The Cro-Magnons also learned how to make fire by rubbing two sticks together.​</a>

                                            Read the two sources of information below about early or prehistoric humans. Then, combine the important information from each source to write a 1-paragraph (5-7 sentences only) synthesis. Source # 1 The Neanderthal Man is an ancestor of the modern human. The fossils of the Neanderthals are discovered in a place called Neander Valley in Germany. He is short and stooped with powerful arms. He has a large brain, a low forehead, an extending jaw, and a round chin. All these features make him look more like an ape- man than a real, modern human. When the climate became cold, they lived in caves. They are great hunters: they hunt for animals like bears, foxes, and wild horses for food. They took the skin as clothing and use the bones for tools as jewelry. The Neanderthals are also skilled in making tools: they made choppers, drills, and spears. Scientists also believe that the Neanderthals bury their dead relatives. Source # 2 The Cro-Magnon is one of our ancestors. They lived on Earth after the Neanderthals, another kind of early human, became extinct. The fossils of the Cro- Magnons were discovered by scientists in a village in France. They were six-footers with a wide face, a high forehead, and a square chin. They look very much like us, modern man! They live in caves and hunt wild animals. A study of the caves where they have lived showed drawings of animals and hunters on the cave walls. They also carve animal figures out of stone and put decorations on their weapons. It looks like the Cro-Magnons are very artistic! They also use animal bones as needles, and they sew clothing from animal skin. The Cro-Magnons also learned how to make fire by rubbing two sticks together.​</a>

                            12. Read the two sources of information below about early or prehistoric humans. Then, combine the important information from each source to write a 1-paragraph (5-7 sentences only) synthesis. Source # 1: The Neanderthal Man is an ancestor of the modern human. The fossils of the Neanderthals are discovered in a place called Neander Valley in Germany. He is short and stooped with powerful arms. He has a large brain, a low forehead, an extending jaw, and a round chin. All these features make him look more like an ape- man than a real, modern human. When the climate became cold, they lived in caves. They are great hunters: they hunt for animals like bears, foxes, and wild horses for food. They took the skin as clothing and use the bones for tools as jewelry. The Neanderthals are also skilled in making tools: they made choppers, drills, and spears. Scientists also believe that the Neanderthals bury their dead relatives. Source # 2: The Cro-Magnon is one of our ancestors. They lived on Earth after the Neanderthals, another kind of early human, became extinct. The fossils of the Cro- Magnons were discovered by scientists in a village in France. They were six-footers with a wide face, a high forehead, and a square chin. They look very much like us, modern man! They live in caves and hunt wild animals. A study of the caves where they have lived showed drawings of animals and hunters on the cave walls. They also carve animal figures out of stone and put decorations on their weapons. It looks like the Cro-Magnons are very artistic! They also use animal bones as needles, and they sew clothing from animal skin. The Cro-Magnons also learned how to make fire by rubbing two sticks together.​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Scientists revealed about the pre-historic humans that so-called the Cro-Magnon and Neanderthals. Cro-Magnon discovered in France alongside with Neanderthal man found in Neander Valley in Germany. Neanderthals were seemed to be like an ape-man. However, it is still difficult to mention that Cro-Magnons were to be an extinct evolution of modern human. Based on its features, they were six -footers with wide face, a high forehead and a square chin which made them looked like us unlike the Neanderthals, they have a large brain, a low forehead, an extending jaw and a round chin which features same as to be homo sapiens or ape man like. Furthermore, the Cro-Magnons carved and sculpted small engravings, reliefs, and statuettes not only of humans but also of animals. Decorated tools and weapons show that they appreciated art for aesthetic purposes as well as for religious reasons while Neanderthals were great hunters and used the skin of the hunted animals for their clothing and mostly live in caves. But still, it is difficult to determine in which discovered  fossil modern being came from.</p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p></p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Crochet (English: /kroʊˈʃeɪ/;[1] French: [kʁɔʃɛ][2]) is a process of creating textiles by using a crochet hook to interlock loops of yarn, thread, or strands of other materials.[3] The name is derived from the French term crochet, meaning 'small hook'. Hooks can be made from a variety of materials, such as metal, wood, bamboo, or plastic. The key difference between crochet and knitting, beyond the implements used for their production, is that each stitch in crochet is completed before the next one is begun, while knitting keeps many stitches open at a time. Some variant forms of crochet, such as Tunisian crochet and broomstick lace, do keep multiple crochet stitches open at a time.</p><p></p><p></p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p>thanks me later<br />
