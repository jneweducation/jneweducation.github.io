statement is true, and write F if the statement if false.
______1. Social constructivists believe that individuals seek understanding of the
world in which they live and work.
______2. The goal of the research is to rely as much as possible on the participants’
views of the situation being studied.
______3. The more open-ended the questioning, the better, as the researcher
listens carefully to what people say or do in their life settings.
______4. Constructivist researchers often address the processes of interaction
among individuals. They also focus on the specific contexts in which people live
and work in order to understand the historical and cultural settings of the
participants.
______5. Researchers recognize that their own backgrounds shape their
interpretation, and they position themselves in the research to acknowledge how
their interpretation flows from their personal, cultural, and historical experiences.
______6. Human beings construct meanings as they engage with the world they
are interpreting.
______7. Humans engage with their world and make sense of it based on their
historical and social perspectives—we are all born into a world of meaning
bestowed upon us by our culture.
______8. Qualitative researchers seek to understand the context or setting of the
participants through visiting this context and gathering information personally.
They also interpret what they find, an interpretation shaped by the researcher’s
own experiences and background.
______9. The basic generation of meaning is always social, arising in and out of
interaction with a human community. The process of qualitative research is largely
inductive; the inquirer generates meaning from the data collected in the field.
______10. A transformative worldview holds that research inquiry needs to be
intertwined with politics and a political change agenda to confront social
oppression at whatever levels it occurs.
______11. Research questions cannot be detached from the research problem.
______12. Research question are comparable to guideposts and a compass.
______13. The keyword in research question formulation is SMART.
______14. The general question must not be specified into smaller questions.
______15. There are two kinds of questions to be asked in a research work.
______16. No research problem means there is research questions.
______17. You do not have to rely your research topic from your research
questions
______18. Your research questions are linked primarily to your research methods.

among individuals. They also focus on the specific contexts in which people live
and work in order to understand the historical and cultural settings of the
participants.

interpretation, and they position themselves in the research to acknowledge how
their interpretation flows from their personal, cultural, and historical experiences.
______6. Human beings construct meanings as they engage with the world they
are interpreting.

participants through visiting this context and gathering information personally.
They also interpret what they find, an interpretation shaped by the researcher’s
own experiences and background.
______9. The basic generation of meaning is always social, arising in and out of
interaction with a human community. The process of qualitative research is largely
inductive; the inquirer generates meaning from the data collected in the field.
