                                            Why Does the Philippines Have 7000 Islands? At a time when there was only a single great mass of land between the great sky and an equally great water, a large prehistoric bird got bored of circling around the same area for millions of years. It had made several attempts to fly as far as it could, to discover what lay beyond the far hori- zons. However, the big bird was always forced to go back, because there was no other land on where he could rest his tired wings. One day, the bird came up with a clever idea. The schem- ing bird told the water that the sky was irritated by the way the water kept on copying the sky's hue. If it decided to don a blue color, then water also became blue; if the sky was clear and white, the water became clear and neutral too. The sky hated it the most that the water imitated even the former's dark mood, because the water also turned gray and somewhat murky. Water of course became indignant upon hearing this; and it heaved a deep breath to which great amounts of water rose up in the form of gigantic waves, high enough to reach the sky and fill its clouds with water. The sky was puzzled at the water's behavior because it seemed that it was intentionally pelting the sky. The scheming bird approached the sky and told the latter that the water was resenting the fact that the sky often made the decisions on what color they had to have. Even if water reflecting itself wanted to try other colors, the sky kept on on the water's surface. Sky, of course, was furious upon hearing this that it let out loud roars of thunder and flashes of lightning that hit not only water but also the large mass of land. It drained out all the waters carried in its clouds while water continued to pelt huge waves against the sky. All these affected the great I mass of land because it slowly softened and weakened as ought against each other's might. Soon enough, the great mass of land started to break into little pieces much to the delight of the bird. Sky and water saw what had happened, and as a result, stopped fighting and tried with all their might to bring back the pieces of land together. It was too late because there were about 7000 pieces of land that were too far away from the main land. The bird of course finally fulfilled his wish of traveling far and wide, beyond the horizons.PLEASE PO I NEED ANSWERS RIGHT AWAY Visual Auditory Olfactory Gustatory Tactile Motion SENSORY IMAGES After Reading 1 Understand 1.

                            25. Why Does the Philippines Have 7000 Islands? At a time when there was only a single great mass of land between the great sky and an equally great water, a large prehistoric bird got bored of circling around the same area for millions of years. It had made several attempts to fly as far as it could, to discover what lay beyond the far hori- zons. However, the big bird was always forced to go back, because there was no other land on where he could rest his tired wings. One day, the bird came up with a clever idea. The schem- ing bird told the water that the sky was irritated by the way the water kept on copying the sky's hue. If it decided to don a blue color, then water also became blue; if the sky was clear and white, the water became clear and neutral too. The sky hated it the most that the water imitated even the former's dark mood, because the water also turned gray and somewhat murky. Water of course became indignant upon hearing this; and it heaved a deep breath to which great amounts of water rose up in the form of gigantic waves, high enough to reach the sky and fill its clouds with water. The sky was puzzled at the water's behavior because it seemed that it was intentionally pelting the sky. The scheming bird approached the sky and told the latter that the water was resenting the fact that the sky often made the decisions on what color they had to have. Even if water reflecting itself wanted to try other colors, the sky kept on on the water's surface. Sky, of course, was furious upon hearing this that it let out loud roars of thunder and flashes of lightning that hit not only water but also the large mass of land. It drained out all the waters carried in its clouds while water continued to pelt huge waves against the sky. All these affected the great I mass of land because it slowly softened and weakened as ought against each other's might. Soon enough, the great mass of land started to break into little pieces much to the delight of the bird. Sky and water saw what had happened, and as a result, stopped fighting and tried with all their might to bring back the pieces of land together. It was too late because there were about 7000 pieces of land that were too far away from the main land. The bird of course finally fulfilled his wish of traveling far and wide, beyond the horizons.PLEASE PO I NEED ANSWERS RIGHT AWAY Visual Auditory Olfactory Gustatory Tactile Motion SENSORY IMAGES After Reading 1 Understand 1.
