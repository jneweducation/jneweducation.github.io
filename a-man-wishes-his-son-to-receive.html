Gospel Mark 9:30-37:
30 Jesus and his disciples left from there and began a journey through Galilee, but he did not wish anyone to know about it.
31 He was teaching his disciples and telling them, “The Son of Man is to be handed over to men and they will kill him, and three days after his death the Son of Man will rise.”
32 But they did not understand the saying, and they were afraid to question him.
33 They came to Capernaum and, once inside the house, he began to ask them, “What were you arguing about on the way?”
34 But they remained silent. They had been discussing among themselves on the way who was the greatest.
35 Then he sat down, called the Twelve, and said to them, “If anyone wishes to be first, he shall be the last of all and the servant of all.”
36 Taking a child, he placed it in their midst, and putting his arms around it, he said to them,
37 “Whoever receives one child such as this in my name, receives me; and whoever receives me, receives not me but the One who sent me.”

"So Jesus called them and said to them, ‘You know that among the Gentiles those whom they recognize as their rulers lord it over them and their great ones are tyrants over them. But it is not so among you; but whoever wishes to become great among you must be your servant, and whoever wishes to be first among you must be slave of all. For the Son of Man came not to be served but to serve, and to give his life a ransom for many’"</a>

Gospel Mark 9:30-37:
30 Jesus and his disciples left from there and began a journey through Galilee, but he did not wish anyone to know about it.
31 He was teaching his disciples and telling them, “The Son of Man is to be handed over to men and they will kill him, and three days after his death the Son of Man will rise.”
32 But they did not understand the saying, and they were afraid to question him.
33 They came to Capernaum and, once inside the house, he began to ask them, “What were you arguing about on the way?”
34 But they remained silent. They had been discussing among themselves on the way who was the greatest.
35 Then he sat down, called the Twelve, and said to them, “If anyone wishes to be first, he shall be the last of all and the servant of all.”
36 Taking a child, he placed it in their midst, and putting his arms around it, he said to them,
37 “Whoever receives one child such as this in my name, receives me; and whoever receives me, receives not me but the One who sent me.”

                                            “Three Sons and a Bundle of Sticks” Once upon a time, an old man lived with his three sons in a village. The three sons were hard workers. Still, they quarreled all the time. The old man tried a lot to unite them but he failed. Though the villagers appreciated their hard work and efforts, they made fun of them on their fights. Months passed by and the old man fell sick. He told his sons to stay united, but they didn’t listen to him, So he decided to teach them a practical lesson so that they would forget their differences and stay united.The old man called his sons. He told them, “ I will give you a bundle of sticks. Separate each stick and you will have to break each stick into two. The one who breaks the sticks quickly will be rewarded more”. The sons agreed. The old man gave a bundle of ten sticks to each of them and asked them to break each stick into two pieces. They broke the sticks into pieces in minutes. And again they started to quarrel among themselves who came first. The old man said, “ Dear sons, the game is not over. Now I will give another bundle of sticks to each of you. You will have to break the sticks as a bundle, not as separate sticks.” The sons agreed and tried to break the bundle of sticks. Though they tried their best, they could not break the bundle. They failed to complete the task. The three sons reported their failure to their father. The old man replied, “Dear sons, see! You could easily break the single sticks into pieces, but you were not able to break the bundle! So if you stay united, nobody can do any harm to you. If you quarrel every time with your brothers, anyone can easily defeat you. I request you to stay united.” The three sons understood the power of unity and promised their father that whatever be the situation, they would all stay together.QUESTIONS;1.

Gospel Mark 9:30-37:
30 Jesus and his disciples left from there and began a journey through Galilee, but he did not wish anyone to know about it.
31 He was teaching his disciples and telling them, “The Son of Man is to be handed over to men and they will kill him, and three days after his death the Son of Man will rise.”
32 But they did not understand the saying, and they were afraid to question him.
33 They came to Capernaum and, once inside the house, he began to ask them, “What were you arguing about on the way?”
34 But they remained silent. They had been discussing among themselves on the way who was the greatest.
35 Then he sat down, called the Twelve, and said to them, “If anyone wishes to be first, he shall be the last of all and the servant of all.”
36 Taking a child, he placed it in their midst, and putting his arms around it, he said to them,
37 “Whoever receives one child such as this in my name, receives me; and whoever receives me, receives not me but the One who sent me.”

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>It is not fair for a mother to give special treatment to only one child and neglect the others. This can cause feelings of resentment, jealousy, and low self-esteem among the other children. All children should be treated equally and given the same amount of love and attention.</p><p></p><p>Giving all the wishes of the youngest son while neglecting the others may lead to a sense of entitlement and dependency on the part of the youngest son. This may also result in a lack of responsibility and independence, which can negatively affect his future.</p><p></p><p>It is important for the mother to understand the impact of her actions and to strive to treat all her children fairly. She should also make an effort to spend quality time with each child and show them that they are equally important and loved. By doing so, she can promote positive relationships among her children and help them develop into confident and well-adjusted individuals.</p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p><strong>Refection on Mark 9:30-37</strong></p><p>This is a momentous occasion and a remarkable milestone for Jesus and the disciples. As Jesus takes his first steps toward Jerusalem, he foreshadows his suffering. His disciples don't understand what he is saying, even if he is trying to teach them. The disciples are depicted in the narrative as slow and dense, unable to comprehend the ramifications of following Jesus. They are apprehensive about approaching him with queries. They are afraid to ask tough questions. Instead, they are consumed by false ambition, self-interest, and rivalry. The followers who were chosen for a unique purpose quarrel about their rank, honor, and significance.</p><p>It's odd that, when Jesus was teaching the apostles about the great act of love he was about to perform on the cross, they were focused on something very different. In all sincere acts of love, the focus is always on the one who is loved, and the joy received in doing so is the satisfaction.</p><p>Jesus will never deceive anyone. He reveals the truth about his suffering to his disciples. The mystery of the cross is presented in a straightforward manner. He doesn't want them to be misled by the picture of a wonderful King who performs miracles. Jesus acts on a much profound level: he relates with all suffering throughout the past and joins them in sympathy, even if it costs him his life. <strong>This is the love that will free us from the grip of evil. God is with the earth's outcasts and will give them priority in his kingdom.</strong></p><p></p><p><strong>A Prayer:</strong></p><p>"Your message is obvious, Lord. God-pleasing desire is demonstrated by humble devotion to others. Glory is found in serving the most inconsequential members of society - the impoverished, the weak, the neglected, and the despised. I'm not different from the disciples, Lord. Your gospel call to loving service can be ignored, rejected, or tamed by me as well. Now that we've each taken a seat, please remind me that true greatness is found in selfless devotion to others. Let me take note of what I can learn about proper attitudes from small children.</p><p>You tried to warn your disciples about the bad news and the good news,  but they refused to listen. They were engrossed in personal rivalries and jealousies, as I am all too frequently. It takes a lifetime to realize how absurd my ego-trips are. Lord, don't be discouraged by my nonsense. Continue to instruct me every day."</p><p></p><p>For more information on how to read the Holy Scriptures, check this </p><p>https://brainly.ph/question/2824859</p><p>For more information about the Bible, check this </p><p>https://brainly.in/question/4183999

                        <p>Long, long ago there lived a man called Sentaro. His surname meant “Millionaire,” but although he was not so rich as all that, he was still very far removed from being poor. He had inherited a small fortune from his father and lived on this, spending his time carelessly, without any serious thoughts of work, till he was about thirty-two years of age.
</p><p>
</p><p>One day, without any reason whatsoever, the thought of death and sickness came to him. The idea of falling ill or dying made him very wretched.
</p><p>
</p><p>“I should like to live,” he said to himself, “till I am five or six hundred years old at least, free from all sickness. The ordinary span of a man’s life is very short.”
</p><p>
</p><p>He wondered whether it were possible, by living simply and frugally henceforth, to prolong his life as long as he wished.
</p><p>
</p><p>He knew there were many stories in ancient history of emperors who had lived a thousand years, and there was a Princess of Yamato, who, it was said, lived to the age of five hundred. This was the latest story of a very long life record.
</p><p>
</p><p>Sentaro had often heard the tale of the Chinese King named Shin-no-Shiko. He was one of the most able and powerful rulers in Chinese history. He built all the large palaces, and also the famous great wall of China. He had everything in the world he could wish for, but in spite of all his happiness and the luxury and the splendor of his Court, the wisdom of his councilors and the glory of his reign, he was miserable because he knew that one day he must die and leave it all.
</p><p>
</p><p>When Shin-no-Shiko went to bed at night, when he rose in the morning, as he went through his day, the thought of death was always with him. He could not get away from it. Ah—if only he could find the “Elixir of Life,” he would be happy.
</p><p>
</p><p>The Emperor at last called a meeting of his courtiers and asked them all if they could not find for him the “Elixir of Life” of which he had so often read and heard.
</p><p>
</p><p>One old courtier, Jofuku by name, said that far away across the seas there was a country called Horaizan, and that certain hermits lived there who possessed the secret of the “Elixir of Life.” Whoever drank of this wonderful draught lived forever.
</p><p>
</p><p>The Emperor ordered Jofuku to set out for the land of Horaizan, to find the hermits, and to bring him back a phial of the magic elixir. He gave Jofuku one of his best junks, fitted it out for him, and loaded it with great quantities of treasures and precious stones for Jofuku to take as presents to the hermits.

                            17. “Three Sons and a Bundle of Sticks” Once upon a time, an old man lived with his three sons in a village. The three sons were hard workers. Still, they quarreled all the time. The old man tried a lot to unite them but he failed. Though the villagers appreciated their hard work and efforts, they made fun of them on their fights. Months passed by and the old man fell sick. He told his sons to stay united, but they didn’t listen to him, So he decided to teach them a practical lesson so that they would forget their differences and stay united.The old man called his sons. He told them, “ I will give you a bundle of sticks. Separate each stick and you will have to break each stick into two. The one who breaks the sticks quickly will be rewarded more”. The sons agreed. The old man gave a bundle of ten sticks to each of them and asked them to break each stick into two pieces. They broke the sticks into pieces in minutes. And again they started to quarrel among themselves who came first. The old man said, “ Dear sons, the game is not over. Now I will give another bundle of sticks to each of you. You will have to break the sticks as a bundle, not as separate sticks.” The sons agreed and tried to break the bundle of sticks. Though they tried their best, they could not break the bundle. They failed to complete the task. The three sons reported their failure to their father. The old man replied, “Dear sons, see! You could easily break the single sticks into pieces, but you were not able to break the bundle! So if you stay united, nobody can do any harm to you. If you quarrel every time with your brothers, anyone can easily defeat you. I request you to stay united.” The three sons understood the power of unity and promised their father that whatever be the situation, they would all stay together.QUESTIONS;1.

A son/daughter must ask for the permission of his/her parents before getting married. c.

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p></p><p>A. Dodong believes that he is already a man at the age of 17.</p><p></p><p>In some cultures, reaching a certain age or milestone may be associated with being considered an adult or a "man." However, adulthood is more than just reaching a certain age. It also involves taking responsibility for one's actions, making mature decisions, and contributing to society. Therefore, whether Dodong is already a man at 17 would depend on various factors, such as his level of maturity, independence, and ability to take care of himself and others.</p><p></p><p>B. A son/daughter must ask for the permission of his/her parents before getting married.</p><p></p><p>In many cultures, seeking parental approval before getting married is a sign of respect and acknowledgment of the importance of family ties. However, the level of parental involvement in the decision-making process may vary depending on cultural, religious, or social norms. Ultimately, the decision to get married should be based on mutual love, respect, and compatibility between the two individuals involved.</p><p></p><p>C. Even if the father does not want to let Dodong/Blas marry at a young age, he did not say anything and approved his son’s wish.</p><p></p><p>It is essential to recognize that the decision to get married involves more than just the individuals involved. It affects their families, social networks, and future generations. Therefore, it is crucial to consider the long-term implications of such decisions and to engage in open and honest communication with all parties involved. If the father did not want Dodong/Blas to marry at a young age, he should have expressed his concerns and discussed them with his son, rather than simply approving his wish without discussion.</p><p></p><br />

D. depends on both the height of the man and the distance from the man to the mirror.</h2><br />
                        Explanation:<br /><br />If a man wishes to use a plane mirror on a wall to view both his head and his feet as he stands in front of the mirror, the required length of the mirror is <strong>equal to one half the height of the man.<br /><br /></strong>It is because when the light emitted from his feet it reflects in the half of a mirror where his eyes can reach.
Since a half mirror and the direction of the person sight will reflect so it can reach the lower half image of a person, thus, he only
needs <strong>a half-length mirror or </strong><strong>one half the height of a man</strong> to see his full image (head to foot). <br />
