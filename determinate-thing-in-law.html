                                            2. Newton's third law of motion states that for every action, there is an equal and opposite re- action. This may sound a bit complicated but in simple terms, it means that in an interaction, there are forces acting upon the two interacting things. For instance, when you skateboard and push backward, the opposite reaction is to drive the skateboard forward. Forces always come in pairs-equal and opposite each other (action-reaction). This concept is similar to that of karma. But, what is karma? According to Britannica.com, karma is the universal causal law by which good or bad actions determine the future modes of an individual's existence. Just like Newton's third law of motion, for a person's every action there is an equal or opposite reaction. Suppose you displayed a kind gesture to an old lady who owns a local store by helping her move the crates of fruit inside the store. Perhaps the next time you see her, she might give you an apple or orange. Or suppose you refuse to give your seat to a pregnant woman standing in the train, and you both alight the train on the same station and it suddenly rains heavily. She gets her umbrella and pops it open and she never offers to walk with you to the next bus stop shed. However, unlike Newton's third law of motion, karma is a choice between an equal or opposite reaction. Whatever our choice is, it creates a ripple effect unto others in which they decide whether to be kind or not to other people.​</a>

                                            True/False (True=A; False=B)1.  According to determinism, all actions except for truly human (free) actions are events that have specific causes for why they happen the way they do.2.  The freedom-determinism question is a metaphysical issue insofar as it acknowledges that there might be a difference between how human behavior appears and how it really is.3.  Determinists believe that human behavior can be explained only if we think of it in the same law-governed ways in which we think of other things in nature.4.  According to determinists, human actions are determined to occur in exactly the way they do because they (like all other events) have specific causes.5.  Determinists acknowledge that, if there were actions that could be explained only in terms of intentions and purposes, then those actions could be considered free; but, in fact, there are no such actions.6.  In hard determinism, freedom and determinism are incompatible because freedom would require that an action be uncaused.​</a>

                            9. 2. Newton's third law of motion states that for every action, there is an equal and opposite re- action. This may sound a bit complicated but in simple terms, it means that in an interaction, there are forces acting upon the two interacting things. For instance, when you skateboard and push backward, the opposite reaction is to drive the skateboard forward. Forces always come in pairs-equal and opposite each other (action-reaction). This concept is similar to that of karma. But, what is karma? According to Britannica.com, karma is the universal causal law by which good or bad actions determine the future modes of an individual's existence. Just like Newton's third law of motion, for a person's every action there is an equal or opposite reaction. Suppose you displayed a kind gesture to an old lady who owns a local store by helping her move the crates of fruit inside the store. Perhaps the next time you see her, she might give you an apple or orange. Or suppose you refuse to give your seat to a pregnant woman standing in the train, and you both alight the train on the same station and it suddenly rains heavily. She gets her umbrella and pops it open and she never offers to walk with you to the next bus stop shed. However, unlike Newton's third law of motion, karma is a choice between an equal or opposite reaction. Whatever our choice is, it creates a ripple effect unto others in which they decide whether to be kind or not to other people.​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>The passage explains the concept of karma, which means that for every action a person takes, there is an equal or opposite reaction in their future. It is a universal causal law by which good or bad actions determine the future modes of an individual's existence. This concept is similar to Newton's third law of motion, which states that for every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction, and forces always come in pairs-equal and opposite each other (action-reaction). However, unlike Newton's law, karma is a choice between an equal or opposite reaction. The passage provides examples of how our actions can create a ripple effect unto others, and it is up to them to decide whether to be kind or not in return.</p><br />

                            18. True/False (True=A; False=B)1.  According to determinism, all actions except for truly human (free) actions are events that have specific causes for why they happen the way they do.2.  The freedom-determinism question is a metaphysical issue insofar as it acknowledges that there might be a difference between how human behavior appears and how it really is.3.  Determinists believe that human behavior can be explained only if we think of it in the same law-governed ways in which we think of other things in nature.4.  According to determinists, human actions are determined to occur in exactly the way they do because they (like all other events) have specific causes.5.  Determinists acknowledge that, if there were actions that could be explained only in terms of intentions and purposes, then those actions could be considered free; but, in fact, there are no such actions.6.  In hard determinism, freedom and determinism are incompatible because freedom would require that an action be uncaused.​</h2><br />

                            30. "The fundamental theme through all the centuries has been the principle that force and power are the determining factors. All development is struggle. Only force rules. Force is the first law... Only through struggle have countries and the world become great. If one should ask whether this struggle is gruesome, then the only answer could be-for the weak, yes, for humanity as a whole, no. Instead of everlasting struggle, the world preaches cowardly, and everlasting peace. These three things, considered in the light of their ultimate consequences, are the causes of the downfall of all humanity."Spartan or Athenian values and explain why that sentence is important.</h2><br />
