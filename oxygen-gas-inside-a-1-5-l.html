                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Boyle's Law states that at a constant temperature, the pressure and volume of a gas are inversely proportional to each other.</p><p></p><p>1. As the volume of the gas decreases, the pressure of the gas inside the container increases.</p><p>2. There is an inverse relationship between pressure (P) and volume (V). This means that as one variable increases, the other variable decreases, while holding temperature constant.</p><p>3. When the pressure on a gas increases, the volume decreases.</p><p>4. Boyle's Law states that at a constant temperature, the pressure and volume of a gas are inversely proportional to each other. Mathematically, this can be represented as P1V1 = P2V2, where P1 and V1 are the initial pressure and volume of the gas, and P2 and V2 are the final pressure and volume of the gas.</p><p></p><p>Problem Solving:</p><p>1. Using Boyle's Law, we can set up the equation P1V1 = P2V2. Solving for P2, we get P2 = (P1V1)/V2. Plugging in the values, we get P2 = (750 mmHg x 50 mL)/120 mL = 312.5 mmHg.</p><p>2. Again using Boyle's Law, we can set up the equation P1V1 = P2V2. Solving for V2, we get V2 = (P1V1)/P2. Plugging in the values, we get V2 = (95 kPa x 415 mL)/110 kPa = 358.6 mL.</p><p>3. Using Boyle's Law, we can set up the equation P1V1 = P2V2. Solving for P2, we get P2 = (P1V1)/V2. Plugging in the values, we get P2 = (1 atm x 450 mL)/50 mL = 9 atm.</p><p>4. Using Boyle's Law, we can set up the equation P1V1 = P2V2. Solving for V2, we get V2 = (P1V1)/P2. Plugging in the values, we get V2 = (5 atm x 4 L)/2 atm = 10 L.</p><p>5. Using Boyle's Law, we can set up the equation P1V1 = P2V2. Solving for V1, we get V1 = (P2V2)/P1. Plugging in the values, we get V1 = (20 atm x 30 L)/25 atm = 24 L.</p><br />
