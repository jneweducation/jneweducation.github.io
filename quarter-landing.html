                                            THE STONE CUTTER Once upon a time, there was a stone cutter. The stone cutter lived in a land where a life of privileged meant being powerful. Looking at his life, he decided that he was unsatisfied with how things were and so he set out to become the most powerful in land. Looking around his land, he wondered to himself what is to be powerful. Looking up he saw the sun shining down on all the land. "The Sun must be the most powerful thing that there is, for it shines down on all the things and all the things grow from its touch." So, he became the sun. Days later, as he shone his powerfully thing on the land, a simple cloud interrupted the greatness. So, he became a cloud, in fact he became the most powerful storm that the world had ever seen. And so he blew his rain and lightning, and resounded with thunder all over the land, demonstrating that he was the most powerful. Until one day he came across a boulder. Frustrated again, he realized that the storm was not the most powerful thing in the land, rather it must be the boulder. So he became the boulder. For days he sat, unmovable and impassive, demonstrating his power, until one day, a stone cutter came and chiseled him to bits.

                            26. THE STONE CUTTER Once upon a time, there was a stone cutter. The stone cutter lived in a land where a life of privileged meant being powerful. Looking at his life, he decided that he was unsatisfied with how things were and so he set out to become the most powerful in land. Looking around his land, he wondered to himself what is to be powerful. Looking up he saw the sun shining down on all the land. "The Sun must be the most powerful thing that there is, for it shines down on all the things and all the things grow from its touch." So, he became the sun. Days later, as he shone his powerfully thing on the land, a simple cloud interrupted the greatness. So, he became a cloud, in fact he became the most powerful storm that the world had ever seen. And so he blew his rain and lightning, and resounded with thunder all over the land, demonstrating that he was the most powerful. Until one day he came across a boulder. Frustrated again, he realized that the storm was not the most powerful thing in the land, rather it must be the boulder. So he became the boulder. For days he sat, unmovable and impassive, demonstrating his power, until one day, a stone cutter came and chiseled him to bits.
