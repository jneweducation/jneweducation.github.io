The direction of a hypothesis points out if the variables have negative or positive relationship with each other. 2. Hypothesis is a statement that defines the testable relationship you expect to see from examining the variables in your research. 3. Theoretical framework explains in detail the variables to be observed in the study as well as the assumed connection between independent and dependent variables. 4. Null hypothesis states the presence of a significant relationship between the independent and dependent variables, or the presence of a significant difference between two means or two proportions. 5. The usual source of conceptual definition is the dictionary. 6. Alternative hypothesis indicates the absence of a relationship/ correlation between two variables, an absence of significant difference between the proportions of two groups of people. 7. Directional hypothesis does not specify the direction of relationship between variables. 8. Operational definition is the universal meaning that is attributed to a word or group of words and which is understood by many. 9. Use an arrow in the conceptual framework when you expect a correlation between two variables, but no cause-effect relationship. 10. Use line in the conceptual framework to indicate cause-effect relationships.​</a>

                            12. Write T if the statement is correct and F if it is wrong. Write your answers on the blanks after the number 1. The direction of a hypothesis points out if the variables have negative or positive relationship with each other. 2. Hypothesis is a statement that defines the testable relationship you expect to see from examining the variables in your research. 3. Theoretical framework explains in detail the variables to be observed in the study as well as the assumed connection between independent and dependent variables. 4. Null hypothesis states the presence of a significant relationship between the independent and dependent variables, or the presence of a significant difference between two means or two proportions. 5. The usual source of conceptual definition is the dictionary. 6. Alternative hypothesis indicates the absence of a relationship/ correlation between two variables, an absence of significant difference between the proportions of two groups of people. 7. Directional hypothesis does not specify the direction of relationship between variables. 8. Operational definition is the universal meaning that is attributed to a word or group of words and which is understood by many. 9. Use an arrow in the conceptual framework when you expect a correlation between two variables, but no cause-effect relationship. 10. Use line in the conceptual framework to indicate cause-effect relationships.​</h2><br />

It's a statement that you or another researcher) thinks is true and one that can ultimately lead you to reject the null hypothesis and replace it with the alternate hypothesis.Converting research questions to hypothesis is a simple task. Take the questions and make it a positive statement that says a relationship exists (correlation studies) or a difference exists between the groups (experiment study) and you have the alternative hypothesis.An alternative hypothesis is one in which a difference (or an effect) between two or more variables is anticipated by the researchers; that is, the observed pattern of the data is not due to a chance occurrence.The alternative hypothesis is the hypothesis that is inferred, given a rejected null hypothesis. Also called the research hypothesis, it is best described as an explanation for why the null hypothesis was rejected. Unlike the null, the alternative hypothesis is usually of most interest to the researcher.statistical hypothesis testing, the alternative hypothesis is a position that states something is happening, a new theory is preferred instead of an old one. It is usually consistent with the research hypothesis because it is constructed from literature review, previous studies, etc.<p></p><strong>H</strong><strong>o</strong><strong>p</strong><strong>e</strong><strong> </strong><strong>i</strong><strong>t</strong><strong> </strong><strong>h</strong><strong>e</strong><strong>l</strong><strong>p</strong><strong>s</strong><p></p><strong>#</strong><strong>C</strong><strong>a</strong><strong>r</strong><strong>r</strong><strong>y</strong><strong>o</strong><strong>n</strong><strong>l</strong><strong>e</strong><strong>a</strong><strong>r</strong><strong>n</strong><strong>i</strong><strong>n</strong><strong>g</strong><br />
