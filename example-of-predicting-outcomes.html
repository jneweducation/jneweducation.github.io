Learning Task 4: Read the sample abstract of a completed quantitative research. Identify
the variables of the study and construct a conceptual framework.
Research Hypothesis
A hypothesis is a prediction of the possible outcomes of a study (Fraenkel &amp;
Wallen, 2009). Hypotheses are statements in quantitative research in which the
investigator makes a prediction or a conjecture about the outcome of a relationship
among attributes or characteristics (Creswell, 2012)
Example of a Research 
Hypothesis
Question: Is there a significant 
relationship between the Grade 11 student-
respondents' availability of internet connection at home and their average sleeping
time?
Null Hypothesis: There is no significant relationship between the Grade 11 student-
respondents' availability of internet connection at home and their average sleeping
time?

                                            Name: ____________________________________  Date: _______ Understanding Dependent and Independent Variables As part of the scientific process, researchers, scientists and even ordinary people conduct experiments every day to find out more about the world we live in. An experiments needs to be carefully designed to make sure it accurately measures what it is supposed to so that the results are correct and so that the experiment can be repeated by someone else. Basic experiments are based upon a hypothesis that tries to predict the outcome of the experiment. Many experiments do not show that their hypothesis is true. These experiments are still valuable because they help to guide further research into an area that scientists are interested in.  Experiments test the influence of one thing over another. A proper experiment compares two or more things but changes only one variable or factor in the experiment. One example that is often used is an experiment that tests the influence of fertilizer on the growth of plants. The hypothesis states that plants that get fertilizer grow taller than plants that get no fertilizer. For any particular plant in the experiment, the amount of fertilizer it will get during the experiment is determined in advance by the experimenter. Some plants will get no fertilizer while others will get a measured amount. In this example, the independent variable is the amount of fertilizer. The other term used in experiments is dependent variable. The dependent variable is what is measured in the experiment. In this example, the dependent variable is how tall the plants are. The dependent variable (how tall the plants are) depends on the independent variable (the amount of fertilizer). Example: Stress increases the heart rate of a person. Dependent variable (what is measured in the experiment):  heart rate Independent variable (what is controlled in the experiment):  the amount of stress Exercise:          Lifting weights increases the breathing rate of a person.          Dependent variable: _______________________          Independent variable: ______________________​</a>

Learning Task 4: Read the sample abstract of a completed quantitative research. Identify
the variables of the study and construct a conceptual framework.
Research Hypothesis
A hypothesis is a prediction of the possible outcomes of a study (Fraenkel &amp;
Wallen, 2009). Hypotheses are statements in quantitative research in which the
investigator makes a prediction or a conjecture about the outcome of a relationship
among attributes or characteristics (Creswell, 2012)
Example of a Research 
Hypothesis
Question: Is there a significant 
relationship between the Grade 11 student-
respondents' availability of internet connection at home and their average sleeping
time?
Null Hypothesis: There is no significant relationship between the Grade 11 student-
respondents' availability of internet connection at home and their average sleeping
time?

                            11. Name: ____________________________________  Date: _______ Understanding Dependent and Independent Variables As part of the scientific process, researchers, scientists and even ordinary people conduct experiments every day to find out more about the world we live in. An experiments needs to be carefully designed to make sure it accurately measures what it is supposed to so that the results are correct and so that the experiment can be repeated by someone else. Basic experiments are based upon a hypothesis that tries to predict the outcome of the experiment. Many experiments do not show that their hypothesis is true. These experiments are still valuable because they help to guide further research into an area that scientists are interested in.  Experiments test the influence of one thing over another. A proper experiment compares two or more things but changes only one variable or factor in the experiment. One example that is often used is an experiment that tests the influence of fertilizer on the growth of plants. The hypothesis states that plants that get fertilizer grow taller than plants that get no fertilizer. For any particular plant in the experiment, the amount of fertilizer it will get during the experiment is determined in advance by the experimenter. Some plants will get no fertilizer while others will get a measured amount. In this example, the independent variable is the amount of fertilizer. The other term used in experiments is dependent variable. The dependent variable is what is measured in the experiment. In this example, the dependent variable is how tall the plants are. The dependent variable (how tall the plants are) depends on the independent variable (the amount of fertilizer). Example: Stress increases the heart rate of a person. Dependent variable (what is measured in the experiment):  heart rate Independent variable (what is controlled in the experiment):  the amount of stress Exercise:          Lifting weights increases the breathing rate of a person.          Dependent variable: _______________________          Independent variable: ______________________​</h2><br />

                        Answer:Sure, here's an exampleLet's say you have a friend who is struggling financially and asks to borrow money from you. You believe it's the right thing to do to help them out, so you lend them the money. However, you also know that they have a history of not being able to pay people back and may struggle to repay you.In this scenario, the intended outcome of your action is to help your friend out, but the unintended consequence may be that you don't get your money back and potentially damage your friendship. To use moral reasoning, you need to weigh the potential consequences of your actions before making a decision. In this case, you might consider offering to help your friend in another way or finding a compromise that doesn't put you at financial risk.<br />
