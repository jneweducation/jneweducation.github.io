                        The initial scope of the Garri Processing Machine was undefined - the unit to be designed could encompass any or all of the processes involved in garri production. The team organized a meeting and teleconference with the customers to gain a better understanding of the needs of West African farmers and the expectations for the unit to be designed. Based on these discussions, the team decided to focus on developing a household unit that would improve the peeling and grating aspects. The decision was made primarily based on the areas in which the team felt they could provide the most significant impact.<br />
