What is the probability that committee will have at least one female?2) A school has 12 good runners of which 5 are girls. If four are chosen at random to represent the school in the district meet, what is the probability that the group will have at most three boys?ACTIVITY 8:Answer the following problems.1) A basket contains red, blue and green balls. One ball is to be chosen at random. The probability that the selected ball is blue is equal to five times the probability that the selected ball is green. If the probability that the chosen ball is green is the same as the probability that the chosen ball is red, find the probability that the chosen ball is blue or red.2) At a particular Junior High School, the number of students in the four grade levels are broken down by percent, as shown in the table:Class:Grade 7Grade 8Grade 9Grade 10Percent:31262518A single student is picked randomly by lottery for a cash assistance to be given due to COVID-19.a.
