                                            ACTIVITY NO. 1 READING ACTIVITY 1: Read the paragraph. Male birds are often more colorful than female birds. For example, the male cardinal is bright red while the female is a duller, rusty color. The male peacock is bright blue and has a vivid multi-colored tail. The female peacock is a drab brown. Male birds are brighter and more colorful so that they can attract mates. The dull color of some female birds makes them harder to see. This helps the females protect their nests and their babies from other birds and animals. Speed ACTIVITYMAIN IDEA CHART WHAT IS THE TOPIC #4 WHAT IS THE MAIN IDEA?
