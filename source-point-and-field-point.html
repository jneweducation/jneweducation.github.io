</strong></p><p><strong>
</strong></p><p><strong>Explanation:
</strong></p><p><strong>
</strong></p><p><strong>Here, we are going to solve for the net electric force of q1 and q2 due to q3 which were arranged in a line. To do this, we are to pair q1 with q3 and q2 with q3 and solve the force per pair. In this case, we are going to use the concept of Coulomb's law to solve for the net electric force using the formula:
</strong></p><p><strong>
</strong></p><p><strong>F = 9 x 10⁹ N·m²/C² Ιqq'Ι / r²
</strong></p><p><strong>
</strong></p><p><strong>where
</strong></p><p><strong>
</strong></p><p><strong>F                is the electric force, unit is in Newtons, N
</strong></p><p><strong>
</strong></p><p><strong>q and q'    are the charges, unit is in Coulombs, C
</strong></p><p><strong>
</strong></p><p><strong>r                 is the distance between charges, unit is in meter
</strong></p><p><strong>
</strong></p><p><strong>Take note the we take the absolute value of the product of the charges in the formula for electric force.
</strong></p><p><strong>
</strong></p><p><strong>For the given information
</strong></p><p><strong>
</strong></p><p><strong>q1 = - 8.0µC = - 8 x 10 ⁻⁶ C
</strong></p><p><strong>
</strong></p><p><strong>q2 = 3.0µC = 3 x 10 ⁻⁶ C
</strong></p><p><strong>
</strong></p><p><strong>q3 = - 4.0µC = - 4 x 10 ⁻⁶ C
</strong></p><p><strong>
</strong></p><p><strong>r13 = 0.5m          distance between q1 and q3
</strong></p><p><strong>
</strong></p><p><strong>r23 = 0.2m         distance between q2 and q3
</strong></p><p><strong>
</strong></p><p><strong>Solving the problem
</strong></p><p><strong>
</strong></p><p><strong>1. First, let us solve for the electric force between q1 and q3. Since we are to solve for the electric force due to q3, this means that we are to pair each charge with q3.
</strong></p><p><strong>
</strong></p><p><strong>So, let us use the formula for electric force and substitute the given information, we have:
</strong></p><p><strong>
</strong></p><p><strong>F13 = 9 x 10⁹ N·m²/C² Ιq1·q3Ι / (r13)²
</strong></p><p><strong>
</strong></p><p><strong>F = 9 x 10⁹ N·m²/C² Ι(- 8 x 10 ⁻⁶ C)(- 4 x 10 ⁻⁶ C)Ι / (0.5m)²
</strong></p><p><strong>
</strong></p><p><strong>F13 = 1.152 N    
</strong></p><p><strong>
</strong></p><p><strong>F13 represents the electric force between q1 and q3.
</strong></p><p><strong>
</strong></p><p><strong>2. Now, let us solve for the electric force between q2 and q3.
</strong></p><p><strong>
</strong></p><p><strong>Using again the formula and substitute the given information, we have:
</strong></p><p><strong>
</strong></p><p><strong>F23 = 9 x 10⁹ N·m²/C² Ιq2·q3Ι / (r23)²
</strong></p><p><strong>
</strong></p><p><strong>F23 = 9 x 10⁹ N·m²/C² Ι(3 x 10 ⁻⁶ C)(- 4 x 10 ⁻⁶ C)Ι / (0.2m)²
</strong></p><p><strong>
</strong></p><p><strong>F23 = 2.7 N
</strong></p><p><strong>
</strong></p><p><strong>F23 represents the electric force between q2and q3.
</strong></p><p><strong>
</strong></p><p><strong>3. Now, we are ready to solve for the net force.
</strong></p><p><strong>
</strong></p><p><strong>∑Fx = F13 + F23
</strong></p><p><strong>
</strong></p><p><strong>∑Fx = 1.152 N + 2.7 N
</strong></p><p><strong>
</strong></p><p><strong>∑Fx = 3.852 N
</strong></p><p><strong>
</strong></p><p><strong>Since q1 and q2 , and q2 and q3 are attractive forces, the charges were pulled toward q3 or to the right of the x-axis, that is why we add the electric forces to solve for the net force.
