What is the purpose of a partnership agreement?5. What form of business ownership is in the best position to raise large amounts of capital?​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>1.If you choose the incorrect business entity, you will eventually discover your mistake. Maybe your company will be sued, or a partner or employee will steal resources. No matter the cause, once you discover you have chosen the incorrect business entity, you will have to get legal help to resolve the issue.</p><p></p><p>2.The sole proprietorship is a popular business form due to its simplicity, ease of setup, and nominal cost. A sole proprietor need only register his or her name and secure local licenses, and the sole proprietor is ready for business.</p><p></p><p>3.Secrecy is another major advantage offered by proprietorship. This is because the whole business is handled by the proprietor himself and, as such, the business secrets are known to him only.

                            17. how do you think the compensation, reward, and incentives system affect the hiring process of prospective employee? how about the longevity of the current employee?​</h2><br />
                        <p>To encourage employees who make direct sales, some companies offer significant incentives for meeting or exceeding goals. For example, Huntington National Bank offered sales teams a program that allowed them to earn points toward an all-expenses-paid trip to the World Series.</p><p>Some employees are more motivated by opportunities than by “prizes.” For these individuals, it may be more motivating to offer trips to trade conferences and conventions, plum assignments, or inclusion in upper-level meetings.</p><p>Benefits are a part of the compensation package, and they are often worth a great deal to employees. Health insurance and retirement, in particular, are valuable and coveted benefits. So too are paid vacations, sick days, life insurance, and retirement packages. Because these benefits are so valuable, it’s important for managers to make their employees aware of what’s available to them—and to work with HR to provide training in how to access and use benefits.</p><p>In most companies, employees can choose among different benefits. There is a cost associated with many benefits, so some employees will opt out (so they can have more in their paycheck) whereas others will opt in (for better health benefits or a greater sense of security in case of disaster).</p><p>Healthcare: Health benefits are usually offered in the form of health insurance, but many companies also offer on-site exercise facilities and programs for reducing stress. Health insurance comes in many “flavors”; often employees can choose among several levels of HMOs, PPOs, health savings accounts, and even on-site clinics.</p><p>Paid vacations: The Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA) does not require payment for time not worked, such as vacations or holidays (federal or otherwise). Some offer very minimal vacation—and hourly or part time workers may get no vacation at all. To compete for highly qualified workers, however, the majority of companies do offer at least some paid vacation. Usually the number of vacation days increases over time—one reason for employees to stay loyal to their employer.</p><p>Retirement: Retirement programs give employees regular income after they leave the company. For many people, a good retirement plan is enough reason to stick with a job, even if the job is less than thrilling. There are two major types of retirement plans: pensions and contribution plans (usually 401(k) plans). Pensions offer regular, guaranteed income to retired employees for the rest of their lives; retirement benefits may also be offered to surviving spouses. Although pensions were popular for many years, most employers no longer offer them. Contribution plans invest funds provided by both the employee and the employer. Funds are invested, and they may grow or shrink depending upon the market. These days, contribution plans are much more common than pensions.</p><p>Stock and Stock Options: If a corporation is large enough, it may offer stock (shares in the company) as one benefit of employment. If the corporation is doing well, stocks can become increasingly valuable. For some employees, stock options are a good way to share in their employer’s success.<br /><br />SYEMPRE JOK LNG HND TLGA YAN YUNG SAGOT</p><br />

                            18. A business ownership capitalization divided into hundreds or thousands of transferable shares of stock and must have at least five owners or investors.</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer: Corporation
</strong></p><p>
A <strong>corporation</strong> is the type of business ownership where it is based and represented by shares or stocks. The owner/s that has/have their own share/s on the company is/are called shareholder/s or stockholder/s. A stockholder can possess a lot of stocks or shares of the company and can transfer it to a successor or sell it to an interested investor anytime. The least number of owners or investors for the business to be considered a corporation is five (5). All shareholders only have limited liability but limited involvement at the same time (unless one is part of the board of directors who have direct involvement with the control of the company).
