A sample of 2,000 was sought to estimate the average achievement in science offifth graders in a city's public schools. The average 5th grade enrollment in the city's elementary schools is 100students. Thus, 20 schools were randomly selected and within each of those schools all fifth graders were tested._________2. A researcher is interested in maximum-security inmates. She groups inmates by thetype of crime committed, determines the percentage of the total in each crime category, and uses that percentageto determine the number of inmates randomly selected from each group._________3. A researcher has a population of 100 third grade children from a local school districtfrom which a sample of 25 children is to be selected. Each child's name is put on a list, and each child isassigned a number from 1 to 100. Then the numbers 1 to 100 are written on separate pieces of paper andshuffled. Finally, the researcher picks 25 slips of paper and the numbers on the paper determine the 25participants.___________4. A sociologist conducts an opinion survey in a major city. Part of the research plancalls for describing and comparing the opinions of four different ethnic groups: African Americans, AsianAmericans, European Americans, and Native Americans. For a total sample of 300, the researcher selects 75participants from each of the four predetermined subgroups.________5. A researcher is interested in political attitudes of individuals within a particularstate. The researcher uses the following procedure to obtain a sample: (a) a random sample of counties is drawn,(b) within the counties selected, districts are randomly drawn, () within each district, blocks are randomlysampled, (d) within blocks selected, building are randomly drawn, and (d) all residents within the buildingsselected comprise the sample._________6. Instructors teaching research methods are interested in knowing what studytechniques their students are utilizing. Rather than assessing all students, the researchers randomly select 10students from each of the sections to comprise their sample.__________7. A researcher is interested in maximum-security inmates. She groups maximum-security prisons by state, randomly selects 10 states, and, from those 10, selects three prisons. She includes allthe inmates in those three prisons in her sample.__________8. Say you wanted to survey professors at KSU about their publication records. Youwant to be sure to include professors from each department, even the very small ones.____________9. Say you want to study the participants who attended a certain activity or event, whatsampling technique will you use?___________10. Say you were interested in sampling students who deal drugs on campus. Whatsampling technique could you use to build this sample?​</a>

A census involves collecting data from every member of the population, so it provides a complete and accurate representation of the population. In this case, since Juan has a list of all the grade five students who took the science examination, he can conduct a census to determine the average score.</p><p></p><p>4) The most convenient data gathering method that Juan can use is a survey or questionnaire. This method allows Juan to collect data from a large number of students quickly and easily. He can create a survey that asks the students about their scores in the science examination, and then distribute it to all the grade five students. The students can then fill out the survey and return it to Juan, who can then use the collected data to calculate the average score. This method is convenient because it is quick, easy, and cost-effective, and it also allows Juan to collect data from a large number of students in a short amount of time.</p><p></p><br />

                            21. ACTIVITY 3: SAMPLING TECHNIQUEIn each of the following examples, identify the SPECIFIC sampling method/technique being used.________ 1. A sample of 2,000 was sought to estimate the average achievement in science offifth graders in a city's public schools. The average 5th grade enrollment in the city's elementary schools is 100students. Thus, 20 schools were randomly selected and within each of those schools all fifth graders were tested._________2. A researcher is interested in maximum-security inmates. She groups inmates by thetype of crime committed, determines the percentage of the total in each crime category, and uses that percentageto determine the number of inmates randomly selected from each group._________3. A researcher has a population of 100 third grade children from a local school districtfrom which a sample of 25 children is to be selected. Each child's name is put on a list, and each child isassigned a number from 1 to 100. Then the numbers 1 to 100 are written on separate pieces of paper andshuffled. Finally, the researcher picks 25 slips of paper and the numbers on the paper determine the 25participants.___________4. A sociologist conducts an opinion survey in a major city. Part of the research plancalls for describing and comparing the opinions of four different ethnic groups: African Americans, AsianAmericans, European Americans, and Native Americans. For a total sample of 300, the researcher selects 75participants from each of the four predetermined subgroups.________5. A researcher is interested in political attitudes of individuals within a particularstate. The researcher uses the following procedure to obtain a sample: (a) a random sample of counties is drawn,(b) within the counties selected, districts are randomly drawn, () within each district, blocks are randomlysampled, (d) within blocks selected, building are randomly drawn, and (d) all residents within the buildingsselected comprise the sample._________6. Instructors teaching research methods are interested in knowing what studytechniques their students are utilizing. Rather than assessing all students, the researchers randomly select 10students from each of the sections to comprise their sample.__________7. A researcher is interested in maximum-security inmates. She groups maximum-security prisons by state, randomly selects 10 states, and, from those 10, selects three prisons. She includes allthe inmates in those three prisons in her sample.__________8.
