At the same moment, both towers sent a radio signal to a ship out at sea, each traveling at 300 m/µs. The ship received the signal from Q 3 µs (microseconds) before the message from R. Find the coordinates (rounded off to two decimal places) of the ship if it is 200 m from the shore (y = 200).​</a>

If water is polluted, marine life, wildlife health and human well-being are affected extensively. To prevent pollution, there must be an immediate check on our daily habits and the types of products we consume, including our knowledge on the causes and effects of water pollution in the environment (Galapon, Relente and       Angeles 2016, 150)             2. English is my favorite subject because I love reading and writing stories about fairy tales, animals, plants, and toys. I also help my classmates who are struggling to read and write. I always top the class in this subject. But I want to make sure that I work hard to love the other subjects. 3. The sender transmits the message while the receiver accepts the message. The most important factor in communication is the good delivery of the message to ensure better understanding which will result in a satisfying answer. Moreover, the tool in communication is as important as the message being sent because it is the channel by which the message is delivered (Diaz 2020, 13) 4. Used cans, either crushed or in their original form can be reused or recycled. However, some tin cans end up in landfill especially if they have undergone chemical change (rusting). When a metal starts to rust, it is hard to reuse because rust will continue to destroy it. To prevent metal from rusting, paint the surface to prevent it from reacting with oxygen (Sarte 2016, 34) 5. The Philippine is rich in coastal areas which are affected by the rising and receding tides because being an archipelago, the Philippines is surrounded by seas and oceans. These areas which are constantly exposed to the changing tides are called intertidal zones. Intertidal zones are home to many kinds of marine animals and birds. The daily changes in the tides play a major role to the life of living things in this area (Sarte 2016, ung tama po sana na sagut ang ma brabrainliest ko​</a>

Taking my sulking to the masses
Writing my poems for the few
That look at me, took to me, shook to me, feeling me
Singing from heartache from the pain
Taking my message from the veins
Speaking my lesson from the brain
Seeing the beauty through the...
Pain!
You made me a, you made me a believer, believer
Pain!
You break me down, you build me up, believer, believer

                                            PENGUINS ANTICS
Penguins are birds that live in the coldest parts of the world. They are black with a white stomach and have small wings. They move across the ice by wadding slowly on their little feet with their wings. They move across the ice by waddling slowly on their feet without to the side. Surprisingly, Penguins cannot fly even though they have wings. They use their wings to balance them as they waddle across the ice. Their bodies are also very good at keeping the penguin 
warm in the cold weather. Penguins are very good at swimming and use the strength in their bodies to move easily through the water. Penguins need to be good swimmers because they eat mostly fish and sea animals. When they catch their food they swallow it whole! They also need to use their strong bodies to get away from seals and sharks because seals and sharks eat penguins. There are lots of different types of penguins and they come in all different sizes and shapes. We all need to make sure we take good care of our world because oil spills and global warming can destroy the penguin’s home.

Water covers more than 70% of the Earth’s surface and constitutes over 60% of the human body. If water is polluted, marine life, wildlife health and human well-being are affected extensively. To prevent pollution, there must be an immediate check on our daily habits and the types of products we consume, including our knowledge on the causes and effects of water pollution in the environment (Galapon, Relente and Angeles 2016, 150)2. English is my favorite subject because I love reading and writing stories about fairy tales, animals, plants, and toys. I also help my classmates who are struggling to read and write. I always top the class in this subject. But I want to make sure that I work hard to love the other subjects.3. The sender transmits the message while the receiver accepts the message. The most important factor in communication is the good delivery of the message to ensure better understanding which will result in a satisfying answer. Moreover, the tool in communication is as important as the message being sent because it is the channel by which the message is delivered (Diaz 2020, 13)4. Used cans, either crushed or in their original form can be reused or recycled. However, some tin cans end up in landfill especially if they have undergone chemical change (rusting). When a metal starts to rust, it is hard to reuse because rust will continue to destroy it. To prevent metal from rusting, paintthe surface to prevent it from reacting with oxygen (Sarte 2016, 34)5. The Philippine is rich in coastal areas which are affected by the rising and receding tides because being an archipelago, the Philippines is surrounded by seas and oceans. These areas which are constantly exposed to the changing tides are called intertidal zones. Intertidal zones are home to many kinds of marine animals and birds.The daily changes in the tides play a major role to the life of living things in this area (Sarte 2016, 85)pa answer po ty​</a>

                            5. 5. Georges PERFORMANCE TASK IN MUSIC (60%) Read the lyrics and explain the message of the tragic opera "Madame Butterfly" by Giacomo Puccini. Write your explanation (at least 5 sentences) at the back of this paper. "Un bel di, vedremo" One good day, we will see Arising a strand of smoke Over the far horizon on the sea And then the ship appears And then the ship is white It enters into the port, it rumbles its salute. Do you see it? He is coming! I don't go down to meet him, not l. I stay upon the edge of the hill And I wait a long time but I do not grow weary of the long wait. And leaving from the crowded city, A man, a little speck Climbing the hill. Who is it? Who is it? And as he arrives What will he say? What will he say? He will call Butterfly from the distance I without answering Stay hidden A little to tease him, A little as to not die. At the first meeting, And then a little troubled He will call, he will call "Little one, dear wife Blossom of orange" The names he called me at his last coming.

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>The opera "Madame Butterfly" by Giacomo Puccini tells the story of a tragic love affair between a young Japanese woman named Butterfly and an American naval officer named Pinkerton. The excerpt of the aria "Un bel di, vedremo" is sung by Butterfly as she waits for Pinkerton's return to Japan. She imagines the day when she will see the smoke from his ship on the horizon and describes her anticipation of his arrival. Butterfly is hopeful that Pinkerton will return to her, but also anxious about what he will say and how she will respond.</p><p></p><p>The aria captures the bittersweet feelings of Butterfly as she waits for the man she loves, but also reflects the cultural differences and power dynamics at play in their relationship. Butterfly is depicted as a vulnerable and naïve young woman who is willing to wait for Pinkerton, despite the fact that he has abandoned her in the past. The lyrics also suggest that Butterfly is aware of the potential for heartbreak and disappointment, but she chooses to believe in Pinkerton's return and the possibility of a happy future with him.</p><p></p><p>Overall, "Madame Butterfly" is a poignant and tragic tale of love and loss, exploring themes of cultural clash, imperialism, and the consequences of reckless actions. The opera remains a popular and enduring classic, celebrated for its beautiful music and evocative storytelling.</p><br />

Water covers more than 70% of the Earth's surface and constitutes over 60% of the human body. If water is polluted, marine life, wildlife health and human well-being are affected extensively. To prevent pollution, there must be an immediate check on our daily habits and the types of products we consume, including our knowledge on the causes and effects of water pollution in the environment (Galapon, Relente and       Angeles 2016, 150)             2. English is my favorite subject because I love reading and writing stories about fairy tales, animals, plants, and toys. I also help my classmates who are struggling to read and write. I always top the class in this subject. But I want to make sure that I work hard to love the other subjects. 3. The sender transmits the message while the receiver accepts the message. The most important factor in communication is the good delivery of the message to ensure better understanding which will result in a satisfying answer. Moreover, the tool in communication is as important as the message being sent because it is the channel by which the message is delivered (Diaz 2020, 13) 4. Used cans, either crushed or in their original form can be reused or recycled. However, some tin cans end up in landfill especially if they have undergone chemical change (rusting). When a metal starts to rust, it is hard to reuse because rust will continue to destroy it. To prevent metal from rusting, paint the surface to prevent it from reacting with oxygen (Sarte 2016, 34) 5. The Philippine is rich in coastal areas which are affected by the rising and receding tides because being an archipelago, the Philippines is surrounded by seas and oceans. These areas which are constantly exposed to the changing tides are called intertidal zones. Intertidal zones are home to many kinds of marine animals and birds. The daily changes in the tides play a major role to the life of living things in this area (Sarte 2016, ung tama po sana na sagut ang ma brabrainliest ko​</h2><br />

You may find your dog’s yapping to be quite annoying, but under some circumstances it can be quite helpful. But people are of great value to dogs too.

Penguins are birds that live in the coldest parts of the world. They are black with a white stomach and have small wings. They move across the ice by wadding slowly on their little feet with their wings. They move across the ice by waddling slowly on their feet without to the side. Surprisingly, Penguins cannot fly even though they have wings. They use their wings to balance them as they waddle across the ice. Their bodies are also very good at keeping the penguin 
warm in the cold weather. Penguins are very good at swimming and use the strength in their bodies to move easily through the water. Penguins need to be good swimmers because they eat mostly fish and sea animals. When they catch their food they swallow it whole! They also need to use their strong bodies to get away from seals and sharks because seals and sharks eat penguins. There are lots of different types of penguins and they come in all different sizes and shapes. We all need to make sure we take good care of our world because oil spills and global warming can destroy the penguin’s home.

Unprecedented efforts are being undertaken at this time. Churchill delivered all of his messages in a concise manner. He utilized repetition to emphasize that Britain would never surrender. Churchill's oratory inspired a people to victory in the face of overwhelming odds. This makes him an example for all aspiring public speakers.</p><p>- Words I do not understand are <strong>about the New World that W.Churchill mentioned. </strong>What is referred regarded as the New World? Is this only for their nation or for all those who wish to follow their leadership? What about the countries where people are still starving and fighting today?</p><p>- Message I get from the speech is <strong>in this speech, Churchill aimed to counter the jubilant public reaction</strong> provoked by the evacuation from Dunkirk and bring the discussion back to reality. But, as Churchill famously cautions in the speech, "We must be very careful not to attach the characteristics of a victory to this deliverance."</p><p>Winston Churchill's unforgettable speeches reinforced Britain's resolve during the terrible times of World War Two. When he was 22 years old, he wrote, "Of all the gifts bestowed upon men, none is more valuable than the gift of oratory. </p><p>- The tone of the speech is <strong>quite solemn, grave, and inspiring.</strong> Winston Churchill was concerned about the welfare of the United Kingdom since he was aware that they could fight or surrender.

Water covers more than 70% of the Earth’s surface and constitutes over 60% of the human body. If water is polluted, marine life, wildlife health and human well-being are affected extensively. To prevent pollution, there must be an immediate check on our daily habits and the types of products we consume, including our knowledge on the causes and effects of water pollution in the environment (Galapon, Relente and Angeles 2016, 150)2. English is my favorite subject because I love reading and writing stories about fairy tales, animals, plants, and toys. I also help my classmates who are struggling to read and write. I always top the class in this subject. But I want to make sure that I work hard to love the other subjects.3. The sender transmits the message while the receiver accepts the message. The most important factor in communication is the good delivery of the message to ensure better understanding which will result in a satisfying answer.

Used cans, either crushed or in their original form can be reused or recycled. However, some tin cans end up in landfill especially if they have undergone chemical change (rusting).

The Philippine is rich in coastal areas which are affected by the rising and receding tides because being an archipelago, the Philippines is surrounded by seas and oceans. These areas which are constantly exposed to the changing tides are called intertidal zones. Intertidal zones are home to many kinds of marine animals and birds.The daily changes in the tides play a major role to the life of living things in this area (Sarte 2016, 85)pa answer po ty​</h2><br />
