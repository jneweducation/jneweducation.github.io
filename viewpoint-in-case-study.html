                            5. what is the viewpoint about the writing of activities covid-19 cases in our province​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Since the early days of the COVID-19 crisis the scientific community has constantly been striving to shed light on various issues such as the mechanisms driving the spread of the virus, its environmental and socio-economic impacts, and necessary recovery and adaptation plans and policies. Given the high concentration of population and economic activities in cities, they are often hotspots of COVID-19 infections. Accordingly, many researchers are struggling to explore the dynamics of the pandemic in urban areas to understand impacts of COVID-19 on cities. In this study we seek to provide an overview of COVID-19 research related to cities by reviewing literature published during the first eight months after the first confirmed cases were reported in Wuhan, China. The main aims are to understand impacts of the pandemic on cities and to highlight major lessons that can be learned for post-COVID urban planning and design. Results show that, in terms of thematic focus, early research on the impacts of COVID-19 on cities is mainly related to four major themes, namely, (1) environmental quality, (2) socio-economic impacts, (3) management and governance, and (4) transportation and urban design. While this indicates a diverse research agenda, the first theme that covers issues related to air quality, meteorological parameters, and water quality is dominant, and the others are still relatively underexplored. </p><p></p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>hope its help</p><p></p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Hoshi entered a residential treatment center for alcohol dependence where the treatment program expected every client to notify his or her family members about being in treatment. This had proven to be a positive step for many other clients and their families in this treatment program, where the belief was that contact with family helped clients become honest about their substance abuse, reconnect with possibly estranged relatives, and take responsibility for the decision to seek treatment.</p><p></p><p>He was reluctant, but staff members persuaded Hoshi to comply with program expectations. He wrote to his family, describing his current life and explaining his need for treatment. It was not until weeks later, after he had been discharged from residential treatment and was participating in the program's continuing care program, that he received a reply. Staff members were shocked to learn that Hoshi's parents had disowned him because he had “shamed” the family by disclosing the details of his life to the program staff, publicly admitting that he had a drinking problem.</p><p></p><p>As Hoshi's story demonstrates, a well-meaning but culturally inappropriate intervention can be counterproductive to recovery. The program applied a “one size fits all” model without being sensitive to the possibility that such an approach might harm the client. Fortunately, Hoshi eventually reconciled with his family, and the program administration and staff began to develop initiatives to improve their cultural awareness and competence.</p><p></p><p>Counselors and other behavioral health service providers who are equipped with a general understanding of how culture affects their own worldviews as well as those of their clients will be able to work more effectively with clients who have substance use and mental disorders. Even when culture is not a conscious consideration in providing interventions and services, it is a dynamic force that often influences client responses to treatment and subsequent outcomes. Although outcome research is limited, culturally responsive behavioral health counseling results in greater counselor credibility, better client satisfaction, more client self-disclosure, and greater willingness among clients to continue with counseling (Goode et al. 2006; Lie et al. 2011; Ponterotto et al. 2000). This Treatment Improvement Protocol (TIP) examines the significance of culture in substance abuse patterns, mental health, treatment-seeking behaviors, assessment and counseling processes, program development, and organizational practices in behavioral health services.</p><p></p><p>Purpose and Objectives of the TIP</p><p>This TIP is intended to help counselors and behavioral health organizations make progress toward cultural competence. Gaining cultural competence, like any important counseling skill, is an ongoing process that is never completed; such skills cannot be taught in any single book or training session. Nevertheless, this TIP provides a framework to help practitioners and administrators integrate cultural factors into their evaluation and treatment of clients with behavioral health disorders. It also seeks to motivate professionals and organizations to examine and broaden their cultural awareness, embrace diversity, and develop a heightened respect for people of all cultural groups. This TIP places significant importance on the role of program management and organizational commitment in the development of cultural competence. Organizational support allows counselors, case managers, and administrators to begin to integrate culturally congruent and responsive services more consistently across the continuum of care—including outreach and early intervention, assessment, treatment planning and intervention, and recovery services.</p><p></p><p>The key objectives of this TIP are helping readers understand:</p><p></p><p>Why it is important for behavioral health organizations and counselors who provide prevention and treatment services to consider culture.</p><p>The role culture plays in the treatment process, both generally and with reference to specific cultural groups.</p><p>Intended Audience</p><p>The primary</p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>For me, it is not wise to lift up the enhanced community quarantine because not all of the inhabitants of the Philippines will follow the guidelines mandated by the government and people going out of their homes will most likely contribute in the transmission of the virus. On the other page, the enhanced community quarantine made people struggle financially especially those who works in order for their families to have food so it was lifted due to that reason because the necessities given by the government are not enough.</p><p></p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>1.When student study literature,they learn to appreciate words and their power.</p><p>2.As you make decisions and take action based on your perseptions there is a risk that these unconsicious biases could negatively affect the outcome.</p><br />What are the Author's Biases?<br /><br />Every author holds opinions that affect his or her discussion of an issue, opinions that you as a reader must try to recognize and understand. Even the most seemingly factual report, such as an encyclopedia article, can carry an understated or implied judgment. Such judgments reflect an author's bias or preference for one side of an issue over another.<br /><br />As you evaluate a source, consider whether the author's bias affects his or her presentation of information and opinions. Ask whether this results in one side of an issue being treated more favorably than another. To explore an author's biases, you must ask where his or her allegiances lie. Is the bias hidden or stated? Ask yourself if you need to look for a balancing viewpoint or approach?<br /><br />Just because an author has a strong bias does not mean that he or she has written something invalid. However, in the interest of being prepared to fend off attacks from those who want to challenge your analysis or argument, it is best if you recognize, early on, to what biases an author does hold.<br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>I think <strong>1</strong><strong>.</strong><strong> </strong><strong> in the control of an outbreak are screening, containment (or suppression), and mitigation. Screening is done with a device such as a thermometer to detect the elevated body temperature associated with fevers caused by the coronavirus. Containment is undertaken in the early stages of the outbreak and aims to trace and isolate those infected as well as introduce other measures to stop the disease from spreading. When it is no longer possible to contain the disease, efforts then move to the mitigation stage: </strong><strong>measure</strong><strong> are taken to slow the spread and mitigate its effects on the healthcare system and society. A combination of both containment and mitigation measures may be undertaken at the same time. Suppression requires more extreme measures so as to reverse the pandemic by reducing the basic reproduction number to less than 1.</strong><strong> </strong><strong> </strong><strong>2</strong><strong>.</strong><strong> </strong><strong>More students say they didn't understand much what is in the modules.

They believe that it can provide convenience to their customers and streamline their business operations. However, they also acknowledge that there are still challenges that need to be addressed, such as the lack of access to digital payment platforms in some areas and the high fees charged by some providers.</p><p></p><p></p><br />
