Situation: A footwear company wants to test the effectiveness of its new insoles (soft insole and air-fill insole) designed to prevent shin splints resulting from running. They hire a group of physical trainers and a statistician, who recruits 100 healthy adult runners with the same age range to participate in a study. The statistician randomly assigns the 60 runners to follow the same weekly running schedule, wherein 30 runners will use new insoles and the remaining 30 will use the existing insoles the company already sells. After 10 weeks, the statistician records the number of runners from each group that has developed shin splints. They made sure that the results are valid that they have performed the testing three times for each treatment. Activity I: Identification of Variables Guide Questions: 1.

1. A book is placed on top of a table. Why does the book stay in place and not fall?
2. A rolling marble on top of a leveled surface gradually stops. How did it happen?
3. A block of wood was pushed and slid on the plank. How did gravity and friction affect the movement of the woof?</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p></p><p>1. The book stays in place and does not fall because of the force of gravity. The Earth's gravity pulls the book downwards towards the ground, but the table is pushing up on the book with an equal and opposite force, called the normal force. These two forces balance each other out, which keeps the book in place.</p><p></p><p>2. The rolling marble on a leveled surface gradually stops because of friction. Friction is the force that opposes the motion of the marble. As the marble rolls, it rubs against the surface of the table, which causes friction. This friction gradually slows down the marble until it stops.</p><p></p><p>3. When the block of wood is pushed and slid on the plank, gravity and friction affect its movement. Gravity pulls the block down towards the ground, while friction opposes the motion of the block on the plank. The amount of friction depends on the roughness of the surface of the plank and the weight of the block. If the surface of the plank is smooth and the block is light, there will be less friction, and the block will slide more easily. If the surface of the plank is rough and the block is heavy, there will be more friction, and the block will slide more slowly or not at all.</p><br />

Situation: A footwear company wants to test the effectiveness of its new insoles (soft insole and air-fill insole) designed to prevent shin splints resulting from running. They hire a group of physical trainers and a statistician, who recruits 100 healthy adult runners with the same age range to participate in a study. The statistician randomly assigns the 60 runners to follow the same weekly running schedule, wherein 30 runners will use new insoles and the remaining 30 will use the existing insoles the company already sells. After 10 weeks, the statistician records the number of runners from each group that has developed shin splints. They made sure that the results are valid that they have performed the testing three times for each treatment. Activity I: Identification of Variables Guide Questions: 1.
