A text response is basically sharing your reaction to a written text. It is an opportunity to let others know how you feel about the book or any text that you have read. It can also be called a reader response. Below are some points that can help you write your response. • How do you feel about what you are reading? • What do you agree or disagree with? • Can you identify with the situation? • What would be the best way to evaluate the story? In writing a response, it is important to do the following: 1. Read the text for understanding. 2. Write the response in a three-part structure (introduction, body, conclusion) 3. Use statements that express reaction (I felt that ... In my opinion.. The author seems to ..., etc.)​</a>

Below are some points that can help you write your response. • How do you feel about what you are reading? • What do you agree or disagree with? • Can you identify with the situation? • What would be the best way to evaluate the story? In writing a response, it is important to do the following: 1. Read the text for understanding. 2. Write the response in a three-part structure (introduction, body, conclusion) 3. Use statements that express reaction (I felt that ... In my opinion.. The author seems to ..., etc.)​</h2><br />
