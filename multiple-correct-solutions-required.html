The purpose of results section is to present and illustrate the findings.5. Make the conclusion section a completely subjective report of the results, and useall interpretation for the discussion.6. Conclusions provide a context, such as by describing the question that was addressedby making a particular observation.7. Conclusion does not describe results of control experiment.8. Conclusion includes observations that are not presented in a formal figure or table.9. The conclusion to be drawn should not come from the indirect implications of thestudy.10. Conclusion section should not be stated in a way that reader will in no way doubtthe correctness of the entire research study.11.

A recommendation report proposes few potential solutions to a problem and concludesby recommending the best one.16. Recommendation reports are overtly persuasive since they make a final recommendationthat is informed by research and evidence.17. A recommendation report does not propose multiple solutions to a problem andrecommends the best one.18. All recommendation reports address a real and important problem.19. Recommendation reports sometimes require in-depth research that can range fromconducting interviews and surveys to reading peer-viewed journal articles or otherrelated documents.20.

                            12. 1 DIRECTION: Write TRUE if the statement is correct, and FALSE if the statement is incorrect. 1. Exponent is a number that gives the power to which the base is raised. 2. In GEMDAS, the "E" stands for Exponents. 3. Integer are all natural numbers known as counting numbers, negatives, opposites, additive inverse and the zero is not included. 4.On the number line, opposite are the same distance from O but on different sides of . 5. Additive inverse property of numbers that if you add opposites, your sum will be 1. 6. A number line is a straight line with numbers placed at equal intervals it can be extended infinitely in both directions. 7. Integer has no fraction or decimals. 8.

                            13. After going through this lesson, you are expected to solve route and non-routine problem involving addition and/or subtraction of fractions using appropriate problem solving strategies and tools Routine problem can easily be solved using at least one arithmetic operation and or ratio. Non-routine problem-is a type of problem that requires analysis, manipulation or derivation of formulas and the like Oftentimes, this problem can be solved in multiple ways. It encourage group discussion in finding the correct solution. Phrases used in addition of numbers are: plus, the sum of the total of increased by, more than and added to. For subtraction we use the words like the difference of, reduced by, diminished by, subtract from, sub- tracted to Learning Task 1. Translate each of the following problem to mathematical symbol.
