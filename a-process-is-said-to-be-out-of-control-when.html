In this process, the observer stays at the place of the survey and observes the objects under consideration and notes down the observations himself. Observation is defined as the primary source of data collection used in descriptive research. It is the most widely used method of acquiring information, in the field of behavioral sciences. We human beings use our senses to observe things that surround us this is also observation, but not scientific. Observation is said to be scientific when it serves the formulated purpose of research. It involves the collection and recording of data, events and objects in a systematic manner. Further, the data is subjected to checks and controls to ensure validity and reliability of data.Answer the question1.

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Observation is something we often do instinctively. Observation helps us decide whether it’s safe to cross the road and helps to determine if cupcakes are ready to come out of the oven. Observation is more than simply noticing something. It involves perception (becoming aware of something by means of the senses) and the recognition of the subject’s importance or significance. Standing on a roadside, our eyes tell us cars are quickly approaching. Prior knowledge warns us that stepping in front of a car is dangerous, so we wait until the road is clear.</p><p></p><p>Dr Nicole Schon outside on grass looking for earthworms by hand.</p><p>Rights: Ross Gray</p><p>Hand sorting earthworms</p><p></p><p>Dr Nicole Schon looks for earthworms by hand sorting through the soil.

Scientists use observation to collect and record data, which enables them to construct and then test hypotheses and theories. Scientists observe in many ways – with their own senses or with tools such as microscopes, scanners or transmitters to extend their vision or hearing. These tools allow for more precise and accurate observations. Scientists also use equipment to measure things like radiation or pH – phenomena not directly observable.</p><br />
