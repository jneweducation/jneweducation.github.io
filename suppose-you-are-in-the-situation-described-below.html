You decide to work temporarily and save for your schooling. You applied at Mr Aquino's restaurant and were hired. After a few days, you noticed that the restaurant business was not doing very well, and Mr Aquino asked for your opinion. What you noticed was that there was no variety in the food being served in the restaurant.1. Prepare a list of different choices of food that may be served (soup, meat/chicken dishes, fish, vegetables, fruits, desserts, beverages). Consider health and nutritional values 2. What mathematical concepts are utilized in this given situation?3. Formulate two problems involving the mathematical concepts in the situation.4. Write the equation (s) or expressions that describe the situation. 5. Solve the equations and problems formulated.5. Present a sample menu for the day and explain the reason for your choice in view of the fact that there will be several possible combinations, explain also why you should prepare certain dishes more often or less frequently.​</a>

                                            It is now time to apply the concept you have learned in Describing the
Mathematical system. Read the situation below and answer the questions that
follow.
A sari - sari store owner bought five different brands of detergent powder
namely A,B,C,D, and E. He bought 20 pieces for each brand. Even at a glance, he
can easily state which brand of detergent powder is the best seller. Now, each
powder claims that it would not irritate the skin after using it. In this case, the
store owner wants to test each brand to prove if the claim is true.
Questions:
1. What represents or describes the undefined terms in the situation?
2. What statement represents an axiom? Why?
3. What statement represents a theorem? Justify your answer.
4. Suppose a variant will cost 2x - 5 = -x + 10 pesos, prove that
each will cost Php5.00. Use two-column form.
5. Suppose A,B,C,D, and E represent the number of packs of
detergent sold for each brand, how much will the sari - sari store
owner earn in total if the cost is 5(A + B + C + D + E) pesos? Use
two - column form.</a>

                            5. It is now time to apply the concept you have learned in Describing the
Mathematical system. Read the situation below and answer the questions that
follow.
A sari - sari store owner bought five different brands of detergent powder
namely A,B,C,D, and E. He bought 20 pieces for each brand. Even at a glance, he
can easily state which brand of detergent powder is the best seller. Now, each
powder claims that it would not irritate the skin after using it. In this case, the
store owner wants to test each brand to prove if the claim is true.
Questions:
1. What represents or describes the undefined terms in the situation?
2. What statement represents an axiom? Why?
3. What statement represents a theorem? Justify your answer.
4. Suppose a variant will cost 2x - 5 = -x + 10 pesos, prove that
each will cost Php5.00. Use two-column form.
5. Suppose A,B,C,D, and E represent the number of packs of
detergent sold for each brand, how much will the sari - sari store
owner earn in total if the cost is 5(A + B + C + D + E) pesos? Use
two - column form.</h2><br />

Even at a glance, he can easily state which brand of detergent powder is the best seller. Now, each powder claims that it would not irritate the skin after using it. In this case, the store owner wants to test each brand to prove if the claim is true. Questions: 1. What represents or describes the undefined terms in the situation? 2.

                            22. Part II Read and understand the situation below, and then answer the question or perform what is required. Suppose you had graduated from high school but did not have enough money to continue your college education. You decided to work temporarily and save for your schooling. You applied at Mr. Aquino's restaurant and were hired. After a few days, you noticed that the restaurant business was not doing very well, and Mr. Aquino asked for your opinion. What you noticed was that there was no variety in the food being served in the restaurant. 1. Prepare a list of different choices of food that may be served (soup meat/chicken dishes, fish, vegetables, fruits, desserts, beverages). Consider health and nutritional values 2. What mathematical concepts are utilized in this given situation? 3. Formulate two problems involving the mathematical concepts in the situation. 4. Write the equation(s) or expressions that describe the situation. 5. Solve the equations and problems formulated. 6. Present a sample menu for the day and explain the reason for your choice. In view of the fact that there will be several possible combinations, explain also why you should prepare certain dishes more often or less frequently.​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>1. List of different food choices with health and nutritional values:</p><p>Soup: chicken noodle soup, vegetable soup, tomato soup</p><p>Meat/chicken dishes: grilled chicken breast, beef stir-fry, pork adobo</p><p>Fish: baked salmon, grilled tilapia, shrimp scampi</p><p>Vegetables: mixed greens salad, roasted mixed vegetables, steamed broccoli</p><p>Fruits: mixed fruit salad, fresh fruit skewers, fruit smoothie</p><p>Desserts: fruit sorbet, yogurt parfait, chocolate mousse</p><p>Beverages: water, iced tea, fresh fruit juice</p><p></p><p>2. The mathematical concepts utilized in this given situation are budgeting, cost analysis, and profit and loss.</p><p></p><p>3. Formulated problems:</p><p>a. If the restaurant owner wants to add a new dish to the menu, and it costs Php 200 to prepare the ingredients for the dish, how much should the dish be sold for in order to make a 20% profit?</p><p>b. If the restaurant owner wants to reduce the number of menu items to reduce costs, and each menu item has an average cost of Php 150 and is sold for Php 250, how many menu items should be removed to reduce costs by 30%?</p><p></p><p>4. The equation that describes the situation is:</p><p>Total cost = Cost per dish x Number of dishes</p><p>Total revenue = Price per dish x Number of dishes</p><p>Profit = Total revenue - Total cost</p><p></p><p>5. For problem a, the equation is:</p><p>Price per dish = Cost per dish + (Cost per dish x 20%)</p><p>Price per dish = 200 + (200 x 0.20)</p><p>Price per dish = 240</p><p></p><p>For problem b, the equation is:</p><p>Total cost = Number of dishes x 150</p><p>Total revenue = Number of dishes x 250</p><p>Profit = Total revenue - Total cost</p><p>Profit = (Number of dishes x 250) - (Number of dishes x 150)</p><p>Profit = Number of dishes x 100</p><p>To reduce costs by 30%, profit must also be reduced by 30%</p><p>New profit = Profit - (Profit x 0.30)</p><p>New profit = Number of dishes x 70</p><p>New total cost = Total revenue - New profit</p><p>New total cost = (Number of dishes x 250) - (Number of dishes x 70)</p><p>New total cost = Number of dishes x 180</p><p>New number of dishes = New total cost / 150</p><p>New number of dishes = (Number of dishes x 180) / 150</p><p>New number of dishes = 1.2 x Number of dishes</p><p>The restaurant owner should remove 20% of the menu items.</p><p></p><p>6. Sample menu for the day:</p><p>Breakfast: mixed fruit salad and yogurt parfait</p><p>Lunch: grilled chicken breast with mixed greens salad and steamed broccoli</p><p>Dinner: baked salmon with roasted mixed vegetables</p><p>Dessert: fruit sorbet</p><p>Beverages: water and fresh fruit juice</p><p>The reason for this choice is to provide a balanced and healthy meal for customers while also utilizing a variety of ingredients to provide different flavors and textures. Certain dishes, such as grilled chicken breast and baked salmon, are prepared more often because they are healthier options that are always in demand. Desserts and beverages are prepared less frequently because they are not essential to a balanced meal and can be more expensive to prepare.</p><p></p><p>Explantation:</p><strong>Pa </strong><strong>Brainly </strong><strong>Po </strong><strong>Ang </strong><strong>tagal </strong><strong>nito </strong><strong>type </strong><strong>please </strong><br />
