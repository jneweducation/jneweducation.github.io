                                            REFLECTION IN FIRST GRADING FOR GRADE-9 SCIENCE
REFLECTION IN MODULE 1
What I learned in module 1 is and how our lungs work, what are its parts where it is located, and where does the air we breathe go, I came to know that it is our blood that takes our oxygen so that we can have energy in our body, the oxygen is very important because oxygen helps replace cells that wear out, provides energy for our bodies, supports the way our immune system functions, Our body needs oxygen why because oxygen to obtain energy to fuel all our living processes, Low blood oxygen levels indicate that there may be an issue with your lungs or circulation. So the air is very important to our body. And I also learned what the order of the parts of the lungs is: Pharynx, larynx, Trachea, Lungs, bronchi, bronchioles, and alveoli.
REFLECTION IN MODULE 2
In module two (2) I learned how cigarettes affect our respiratory and circulatory systems, I always learned how to avoid smoking and stay away from the smoker because you can still inhale the chemical of its smoke, we also studied what are the chemicals in cigarettes, and what can happen to our respiratory and circulatory system, and what diseases can be contracted from cigarette smoke, we have also studied what can happen to your mouth, tongue, and lungs if you smoke, TAR may stick to your lips, your breath may stink, and you may get sick to your lungs.
REFLECTION IN MODULE 3
In module 3 I learned about the components and structure of DNA, genes and chromosomes, and Incomplete dominance and co-dominance. DNA is made of chemical building blocks called nucleotides. These building blocks are made of three parts: a phosphate group, a sugar group, and one of four types of nitrogen bases. To form a strand of DNA, nucleotides are linked into chains, with the phosphate and sugar groups alternating. Why genes and chromosomes are important Genes contain the data needed to build and maintain cells and pass genetic information to offspring. Each cell contains two sets of chromosomes: One set comes from the mother and the other comes from the father. Incomplete dominance is when the phenotypes of the two parents blend to create a new phenotype for their offspring. An example is a white flower and a red flower producing pink flowers. Codominance is when the two parent phenotypes are expressed together in the offspring. What is the difference between incomplete dominance and codominance? Codominance signifies that no allele can block or mask the expression of the other allele. Incomplete dominance signifies the condition in which a dominant allele does not completely mask the effects of a recessive allele. Similarities Between Codominance and Incomplete Dominance both parental alleles inherited are dominant.
REFLECTION IN MODULE 4
The population density of an area can be one of the most important determining factors for business and marketing planning. It is not enough to know how many consumers live in a specific state or city. Population density describes the number of individuals occupying an area in relation to the size of the area they occupy. Studying population growth also helps scientists understand what causes changes in population sizes and growth rates. Clumped dispersion is when individuals in a population are clustered together, creating some patches with many individuals and some patches with no individuals. In uniform dispersion, individuals are spaced evenly throughout an area. And in random dispersion, individuals are arranged without any apparent pattern.
REFLECTION IN MODULE 5
The light-dependent reactions convert light energy into chemical energy. The goal of the light-dependent reactions of photosynthesis is to collect energy from the sun and break down water molecules to produce ATP and NADPH. These two energy-storing molecules are then used in the light-independent reactions. In the light-dependent reactions, energy from sunlight is absorbed by chlorophyll and that energy is converted into stored chemical energy. In the light-independent reactions, the chemical energy harvested during the light-dependent reactions drives the assembly of sugar molecules from carbon dioxide. photosynthesis, the process by which green plants and certain other organisms transform light energy into chemical energy. During photosynthesis in green plants, light energy is captured and used to convert water, carbon dioxide, and minerals into oxygen and energy-rich organic compounds. The importance of photosynthesis in our life is the oxygen it produces.

A philosophical or political theory may also be the subject of a critique. 18. Structural critique assesses literary works according to moral rather than formal principles. 19. Marxist criticism considers literary works as reflections of the social institutions from which they originate 20. Formalist criticism is concerned with the ways in which the subject reinforces or undermines the economic political, social, and psychological oppression of women. 21. The Marxist examines the form or structure of the subject to be criticized as a whole. 22. Reader-response describes what happens in the reader's mind while interpreting a text and reflects that reading, like writing, is a creative process. 23. The concern in moral criticism is not only to discover meaning but also to determine whether works of literature are both true and significant. 24. Historical criticism explores the historical, social, political and cultural contexts surrounding the creation and reception of a work of literature; it uses history as a means of understanding a literary work more clearly. 25. There is no right or wrong answer to a reading response critique. Nonetheless, it is important that you demonstrate an understanding of the reading and clearly explain and support your reactions.​</a>

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Subject Matter: Oskar Kokoschka's "Bride of the Wind" depicts a woman in a white dress standing in a boat with a sail billowing behind her. The other figures in the artwork include a man and a woman, both with their backs to the viewer, and a small child with its back to the woman.</p><p></p><p>Materials: The painting is oil on canvas. The use of oil paints allows for the artist to create a strong contrast between the light and the dark, which draws the viewer's attention to the central figure of the woman.</p><p></p><p>The Art, Elements and Principles: The dominant elements of the painting are the contrast between light and dark and the strong lines used to define the shapes and volumes of the figures. The unifying features of the composition are the repetition of curves and the use of light to create a sense of movement and energy.</p><p></p><p>Analysis: The painting conveys the feeling of movement, freedom and possibility. The contrast between the light and dark creates a strong visual impact, while the strong lines and curves used to define the figures' shapes and volumes give the painting a sense of energy and movement. The use of oil paints also brings out the artist's intended effect of creating a sense of atmosphere and mood.</p><p></p><p>Interpretation: The painting conveys a message of hope and freedom. The woman in the boat is the central figure, who is setting off on a journey of discovery and freedom. The two figures with their backs to the viewer represent the past, while the small child symbolizes new beginnings and possibilities. Overall, the painting conveys the idea that although the path ahead may be uncertain, the journey is worth taking.</p><br />

                            18. REFLECTION IN FIRST GRADING FOR GRADE-9 SCIENCE
REFLECTION IN MODULE 1
What I learned in module 1 is and how our lungs work, what are its parts where it is located, and where does the air we breathe go, I came to know that it is our blood that takes our oxygen so that we can have energy in our body, the oxygen is very important because oxygen helps replace cells that wear out, provides energy for our bodies, supports the way our immune system functions, Our body needs oxygen why because oxygen to obtain energy to fuel all our living processes, Low blood oxygen levels indicate that there may be an issue with your lungs or circulation. So the air is very important to our body. And I also learned what the order of the parts of the lungs is: Pharynx, larynx, Trachea, Lungs, bronchi, bronchioles, and alveoli.
REFLECTION IN MODULE 2
In module two (2) I learned how cigarettes affect our respiratory and circulatory systems, I always learned how to avoid smoking and stay away from the smoker because you can still inhale the chemical of its smoke, we also studied what are the chemicals in cigarettes, and what can happen to our respiratory and circulatory system, and what diseases can be contracted from cigarette smoke, we have also studied what can happen to your mouth, tongue, and lungs if you smoke, TAR may stick to your lips, your breath may stink, and you may get sick to your lungs.
REFLECTION IN MODULE 3
In module 3 I learned about the components and structure of DNA, genes and chromosomes, and Incomplete dominance and co-dominance. DNA is made of chemical building blocks called nucleotides. These building blocks are made of three parts: a phosphate group, a sugar group, and one of four types of nitrogen bases. To form a strand of DNA, nucleotides are linked into chains, with the phosphate and sugar groups alternating. Why genes and chromosomes are important Genes contain the data needed to build and maintain cells and pass genetic information to offspring. Each cell contains two sets of chromosomes: One set comes from the mother and the other comes from the father. Incomplete dominance is when the phenotypes of the two parents blend to create a new phenotype for their offspring. An example is a white flower and a red flower producing pink flowers. Codominance is when the two parent phenotypes are expressed together in the offspring. What is the difference between incomplete dominance and codominance? Codominance signifies that no allele can block or mask the expression of the other allele. Incomplete dominance signifies the condition in which a dominant allele does not completely mask the effects of a recessive allele. Similarities Between Codominance and Incomplete Dominance both parental alleles inherited are dominant.
REFLECTION IN MODULE 4
The population density of an area can be one of the most important determining factors for business and marketing planning. It is not enough to know how many consumers live in a specific state or city. Population density describes the number of individuals occupying an area in relation to the size of the area they occupy. Studying population growth also helps scientists understand what causes changes in population sizes and growth rates. Clumped dispersion is when individuals in a population are clustered together, creating some patches with many individuals and some patches with no individuals. In uniform dispersion, individuals are spaced evenly throughout an area. And in random dispersion, individuals are arranged without any apparent pattern.
REFLECTION IN MODULE 5
The light-dependent reactions convert light energy into chemical energy. The goal of the light-dependent reactions of photosynthesis is to collect energy from the sun and break down water molecules to produce ATP and NADPH. These two energy-storing molecules are then used in the light-independent reactions. In the light-dependent reactions, energy from sunlight is absorbed by chlorophyll and that energy is converted into stored chemical energy. In the light-independent reactions, the chemical energy harvested during the light-dependent reactions drives the assembly of sugar molecules from carbon dioxide. photosynthesis, the process by which green plants and certain other organisms transform light energy into chemical energy. During photosynthesis in green plants, light energy is captured and used to convert water, carbon dioxide, and minerals into oxygen and energy-rich organic compounds. The importance of photosynthesis in our life is the oxygen it produces.

A philosophical or political theory may also be the subject of a critique. 18. Structural critique assesses literary works according to moral rather than formal principles. 19. Marxist criticism considers literary works as reflections of the social institutions from which they originate 20. Formalist criticism is concerned with the ways in which the subject reinforces or undermines the economic political, social, and psychological oppression of women. 21. The Marxist examines the form or structure of the subject to be criticized as a whole. 22. Reader-response describes what happens in the reader's mind while interpreting a text and reflects that reading, like writing, is a creative process. 23. The concern in moral criticism is not only to discover meaning but also to determine whether works of literature are both true and significant. 24. Historical criticism explores the historical, social, political and cultural contexts surrounding the creation and reception of a work of literature; it uses history as a means of understanding a literary work more clearly. 25. There is no right or wrong answer to a reading response critique.
