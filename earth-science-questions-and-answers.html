                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Ninety-seven percent of Earth’s water is salty ocean water and another two percent is trapped in Earth’s ice caps and glaciers. The precious one percent that remains must be used wisely. Drip irrigation, seen here in action on an Israeli farm, can cut agricultural water demand by seventy percent—yet it’s used on only 2 percent of the planet’s irrigated cropland.</p><p></p><p>The Earth’s natural resources include air, water, soil, minerals, fuels, plants, and animals. Conservation is the practice of caring for these resources so all living things can benefit from them now and in the future.</p><p></p><p>All the things we need to survive, such as food, water, air, and shelter, come from natural resources. Some of these resources, like small plants, can be replaced quickly after they are used. Others, like large trees, take a long time to replace. These are renewable resources.</p><p></p><p>Other resources, such as fossil fuels, cannot be replaced at all. Once they are used up, they are gone forever. These are nonrenewable resources.</p><p></p><p>People often waste natural resources. Animals are overhunted. Forests are cleared, exposing land to wind and water damage. Fertile soil is exhausted and lost to erosion because of poor farming practices. Fuel supplies are depleted. Water and air are polluted.</p><p></p><p>If resources are carelessly managed, many will be used up. If used wisely and efficiently, however, renewable resources will last much longer. Through conservation, people can reduce waste and manage natural resources wisely.</p><p></p><p>The population of human beings has grown enormously in the past two centuries. Billions of people use up resources quickly as they eat food, build houses, produce goods, and burn fuel for transportation and electricity. The continuation of life as we know it depends on the careful use of natural resources.</p><p></p><p>The need to conserve resources often conflicts with other needs. For some people, a wooded area may be a good place to put a farm. A timber company may want to harvest the area’s trees for construction materials. A business may want to build a factory or shopping mall on the land.</p><p></p><p>All these needs are valid, but sometimes the plants and animals that live in the area are forgotten. The benefits of development need to be weighed against the harm to animals that may be forced to find new habitats, the depletion of resources we may want in the future (such as water or timber), or damage to resources we use today.</p><p></p><p>Development and conservation can coexist in harmony. When we use the environment in ways that ensure we have resources for the future, it is called sustainable development. There are many different resources we need to conserve in order to live sustainably.</p><p></p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>brainliest me pls</p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Earth is our home, and we don’t have another planet to go to.
So earth is of vital importance for humanity as it gives us a place to survive, to thrive and develop.
Earth is also - as far as we know - a pretty unique place in the universe that has great biodiversity - both in plants and in animals. That value can hardly be measured.
We are the custodians of earth, and we have done a pretty lousy job in keeping our home clean and workable.
We should do everything in our power to protect our home environment and the biodiversity that exists here.</p><p></p><p></p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>dahja  had not work you know</p><p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>1. When there is movement below the earth's surface, it can cause earthquakes or volcanic activity.</p><p>2. Volcanic eruptions occur when magma, gas, and ash are released from a volcano's vent. This can happen due to pressure building up within the volcano or because of tectonic activity.</p><p>3. Tsunamis are caused by underwater earthquakes, volcanic eruptions, or landslides. These events can displace a large amount of water, creating a series of large waves that can travel across the ocean.</p><p>4. The energy released by an earthquake is measured on the Richter scale, which is based on the magnitude of the quake. This energy is generated by the movement of tectonic plates and can cause significant damage to the surrounding area.</p><p>5. The extent of damage caused by an earthquake depends on a variety of factors, including the magnitude of the quake, the distance from the epicenter, and the type of soil and structures in the affected area. Stronger earthquakes can cause more damage, and areas with older or poorly constructed buildings may be more vulnerable to collapse.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p> <strong>1. What is the effect of the earth's rotation? </strong></p><p>⇒ The Earth's rotation causes the day to turn to night, and the Earth's whole rotation/revolution causes summer to turn to winter. The Earth's spinning and revolution, when combined, affect wind direction, temperature, ocean currents, and precipitation, resulting in our daily weather and global climate.</p><p> <strong>2. What do you think are the occurrences as the Earth revolves around the sun?</strong></p><p>⇒ <strong>There'll be spring and autumn.</strong> The Sun rotates around the Earth. As the Earth revolves around the Sun, the North Pole always points in the same direction. Seasons are caused by the Earth's rotation around the sun.</p><p><strong>3. What do equinox and the solstice mean?​</strong></p><p>⇒ The solstices are the year's longest and shortest days, whereas the equinoxes occur when day and night are of similar duration.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p>pa brainlest nlng thx!<br />
