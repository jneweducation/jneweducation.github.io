                                            Date : September 28, 2021 ARTS A. Identify the following. 1. Materials used in sculptures vary according to region and locality. Archeologists believed that their sculpture is a result of natural erosion and not of human artistry. 2. Symbolic elements were widely used such as forms, hieroglyphics, relative size, location, materials, color, actions and gestures. Their tombs required the most extensive used of sculpture. 3. Most their sculptures are made of monumental terra-cotta. 4. Animals were used as symbols (dove, deer, peafowl) while some had acrostic signs (form of writing in which taking the first letter; syllable or word of different lines and putting them together it can be read a message that contained a great theological significance. 5. Some of the famous sculptural pieces are reliquaries, altar frontals, crucifixes, and devotional images. Small individual works of art were generally made of costly materials for royal and aristocratic patrons. 6. Their sculptures were tense and stiff, their bodies were hidden within enfolding robes. After three centuries of experiments, Greek sculpiures had finally evolved and showed all the points of human anatomy and proportion. 7. Man has developed a form of architecture based on megaliths (a big rock) from the Greek word lithos (stone) and megas (big). 8. This architectural style was developed during the pre-dynastic period 4,000 BC. 9. They built sturdy stone structures both for use and to perpetuate their glory. 10. Their architecture displayed solid masonry walls, rounded arches and masonry vaults. It is the period of great building activities in Europe, castles, churches, monasteries arose everywhere. 11. This design included two new devices: pointed arch which enabled builders to construct much higher ceiling vaults and vaulting borne on a network of stone ribs supported by piers and clustered pillars. 12. Method of painting water-based pigments on a freshly applied plaster usually on a wall surface. 13. It is an art process where an image is created using an assemblage of small pieces of colored glass, stones, or other materials. 14. Developed to use by Greek ship builders, who used the hot wax to fill the cracks of the ship. 15. A huge stone standing vertically on the ground, usually standing in the middle of the field or arranged in rows.

                                            The process by which food is
changed into a form that the body
can use is _____1_____. It starts
when food is taken into the mouth.
This is called ____2____. The food
is broken down to smaller pieces by
chewing, tearing and grinding as a
means of ______3_____digestion.
The pieces mix with saliva which
softens and wets the food before
you swallow that contains enzymesmolecules that speed up chemical
reactions, initially starts the
chemical digestion. The enzyme
amylase digests starch.
The bolus, the partially
digested food and the end product
of mechanical and chemical
digestion in mouth enters the
esophagus and is moved down into
the ______4_____where it mixes
with gastric juices and acids.
Mechanical digestion happens in
the stomach by churning the bolus
through muscular peristaltic
contractions. The acid secreted in
the stomach is called hydrochloric
acid which helps digest food. The
enzyme pepsin digests protein.
Protein digestion starts in the
stomach. Other enzymes such as
protease and lipase help break
down proteins in the stomach and
fats in the small intestine
respectively. After mechanical and
chemical digestion of food in the
stomach, the bolus turns into a
chyme -consists of gastric juices
and partly digested food.
As the chyme enters the small
intestine it will further undergo the
process of mechanical and
chemical digestion. The pancreatic
fluid contains enzymes that digest proteins, fats and carbohydrates. The pancreatic fluid also contains sodium bicarbonate, which
neutralizes the acid in the chyme, protecting the lining of the small intestine and enabling some enzymes to work. The bile secreted
in the liver breaks fat into smaller pieces. Digested molecules of food are absorbed through the _______5_____. The walls of the
small intestine contain many folds that are lined up with many tine finger-like protrusions called villi. These villi are in turn covered
with even smaller protrusions called microvilli. These structures increase the surface area through which nutrients are absorbed.
During______6____, these nutrients pass through the walls of the intestine and into the bloodstream where they get transported to
the different parts of the body.
After absorption, the next process is _______7_______ which is the movement of digested food molecules into the cells of
the body where they are used. For example: glucose is used in respiration to provide energy, and amino acids are used to build new
proteins. The liver is important in assimilation. For example, it converts glucose into glycogen (a complex carbohydrate used for
storage) and amino acids into proteins.
The small intestine absorbs most of the water in the contents of the gut. By the time the contents reach the end of the small
intestine, most of the digested food has also been absorbed.
The remaining material consists of: water bacteria (living and dead) cells from the lining of the gut indigestible substances -
such as cellulose from plant cell walls.
The colon is the first part of the______8_____. The large intestine reabsorbed the water from the remaining food in the digestive
tract and water-soluble vitamins are absorbed along with water. It absorbs most of the remaining water. This leaves semi-solid waste
material called______9_____. The feces are stored in the rectum, the last part of the large intestine. _____10_______ happens when
these feces pass out of the body through the anus.</a>

                                            Reflection About this short story
THE BLIND BUS PASSENGER
It had been a year since Susan, 34, became blind. Due to a medical
misdiagnosis she had been rendered sightless, and she was suddenly thrown
into a world of darkness, anger, frustration and self-pity. And all she had
to cling to was her husband, Mark.
Mark was an Army officer and he loved Susan with all his heart. When she
first lost her sight, he watched her sink into despair and was determined to
help his wife gain the strength and confidence she needed to become
independent again.
Finally, Susan felt ready to return to her job, but how would she get there?
She used to take the bus, but was now too frightened to get around the city
by herself. Mark volunteered to drive her to work each day, even though they
worked at opposite ends of the city. At first, this comforted Susan, and
fulfilled Mark's need to protect his sightless wife who was so insecure
about performing the slightest task. Soon, however, Mark realized the arrangement
wasn't working. Susan is going to have to start taking the bus again, he
admitted to himself. But she was still so fragile, so angry - how would she react?
Just as he predicted, Susan was horrified at the idea of taking the bus
again. "I'm blind!", she responded bitterly. "How am I supposed to know
where I am going? I feel like you're abandoning me."
Mark's heart broke to hear these words, but he knew what had to be done.
He promised Susan that each morning and evening he would ride the bus with
her, for as long as it took, until she got the hang of it.
And that is exactly what happened. For two solid weeks, Mark, military
uniform and all, accompanied Susan to and from work each day. He taught her
how to rely on her other senses, specifically her hearing, to determine
where she was and how to adapt to her new environment. He helped her
befriend the bus drivers who could watch out for her, and save her a seat.
Finally, Susan decided that she was ready to try the trip on her own.
Monday morning arrived, and before she left, she threw her arms around Mark,
her temporary bus-riding companion, her husband, and her best friend. Her
eyes filled with tears of gratitude for his loyalty, his patience, and his love.
She said good-bye, and for the first time, they went their separate ways.
Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday... Each day on her own went perfectly,
and Susan had never felt better. She was doing it! She was going to work all by herself.
On Friday morning, Susan took the bus to work as usual. As she was paying
the fare to exit the bus, the driver said, "Boy, I sure do envy you."
Susan wasn't sure if the driver was speaking to her or not. After all, who
on earth would ever envy a blind woman who had struggled just to find the
courage to live for the past year? Curious, she asked the driver, "Why do
you say that you envy me?"
The driver responded, "It must feel good to be taken care of and protected like you are."
Susan had no idea what the driver was talking about, and again asked, "What do you mean?"
The driver answered, "You know, every morning for the past week, a fine
looking gentleman in a military uniform has been standing across the corner
watching you as you get off the bus. He makes sure you cross the street
safely and he watches until you enter your office building. Then he blows
you a kiss, gives you a little salute and walks away. You are one lucky lady."
Tears of happiness poured down Susan's cheeks. For although she couldn't
physically see him, she had always felt Mark's presence. She was lucky, so
lucky, for he had given her a gift more powerful than sight, a gift she
didn't need to see to believe - the gift of love that can bring light where
there is darkness.</a>

                        <p>Volcanic eruptions produce various effects on the Earth's surface. Firstly, from the volcano comes out hot magma, ash, and gases. The magma flows down the sides of the volcano and cools as it touches the ground, forming solid rocks. This process is called lava flows, and it contributes to the formation of new land masses. Secondly, volcanic eruptions make the Earth's surface appear rough and uneven. As these new materials build upon the surface, they create cone-shaped volcanoes. This build-up of materials can happen quickly or slowly over long periods of time.</p><p></p><p>The lava that comes out during an eruption not only changes the appearance but also the texture of the Earth's surface. The new rocks are rough, sharp, and have an irregular surface. The lava flows and makes the Earth's surface appear to have rivers of rock. The changes that result from volcanic eruptions can happen quickly or slowly, and they can have a significant effect on the Earth's surface. In some cases, volcanic eruptions can cause severe damage to property and infrastructure, and in the worst cases, they can cause loss of life.</p><p></p><p>In conclusion, volcanic eruptions have various effects on the Earth's surface. They produce solid rocks, change the appearance and texture of the Earth's surface, and create new land masses. These changes can happen quickly or slowly and have long-lasting effects on the environment. While volcanic eruptions can be dangerous, they are also important in shaping the Earth's surface and creating new habitats for various species of plants and animals.</p><br />

                            10. Date : September 28, 2021 ARTS A. Identify the following. 1. Materials used in sculptures vary according to region and locality. Archeologists believed that their sculpture is a result of natural erosion and not of human artistry. 2. Symbolic elements were widely used such as forms, hieroglyphics, relative size, location, materials, color, actions and gestures. Their tombs required the most extensive used of sculpture. 3. Most their sculptures are made of monumental terra-cotta. 4. Animals were used as symbols (dove, deer, peafowl) while some had acrostic signs (form of writing in which taking the first letter; syllable or word of different lines and putting them together it can be read a message that contained a great theological significance. 5. Some of the famous sculptural pieces are reliquaries, altar frontals, crucifixes, and devotional images. Small individual works of art were generally made of costly materials for royal and aristocratic patrons. 6. Their sculptures were tense and stiff, their bodies were hidden within enfolding robes. After three centuries of experiments, Greek sculpiures had finally evolved and showed all the points of human anatomy and proportion. 7. Man has developed a form of architecture based on megaliths (a big rock) from the Greek word lithos (stone) and megas (big). 8. This architectural style was developed during the pre-dynastic period 4,000 BC. 9. They built sturdy stone structures both for use and to perpetuate their glory. 10. Their architecture displayed solid masonry walls, rounded arches and masonry vaults. It is the period of great building activities in Europe, castles, churches, monasteries arose everywhere. 11. This design included two new devices: pointed arch which enabled builders to construct much higher ceiling vaults and vaulting borne on a network of stone ribs supported by piers and clustered pillars. 12. Method of painting water-based pigments on a freshly applied plaster usually on a wall surface. 13. It is an art process where an image is created using an assemblage of small pieces of colored glass, stones, or other materials. 14. Developed to use by Greek ship builders, who used the hot wax to fill the cracks of the ship. 15. A huge stone standing vertically on the ground, usually standing in the middle of the field or arranged in rows.

                            13. The process by which food is
changed into a form that the body
can use is _____1_____. It starts
when food is taken into the mouth.
This is called ____2____. The food
is broken down to smaller pieces by
chewing, tearing and grinding as a
means of ______3_____digestion.
The pieces mix with saliva which
softens and wets the food before
you swallow that contains enzymesmolecules that speed up chemical
reactions, initially starts the
chemical digestion. The enzyme
amylase digests starch.
The bolus, the partially
digested food and the end product
of mechanical and chemical
digestion in mouth enters the
esophagus and is moved down into
the ______4_____where it mixes
with gastric juices and acids.
Mechanical digestion happens in
the stomach by churning the bolus
through muscular peristaltic
contractions. The acid secreted in
the stomach is called hydrochloric
acid which helps digest food. The
enzyme pepsin digests protein.
Protein digestion starts in the
stomach. Other enzymes such as
protease and lipase help break
down proteins in the stomach and
fats in the small intestine
respectively. After mechanical and
chemical digestion of food in the
stomach, the bolus turns into a
chyme -consists of gastric juices
and partly digested food.
As the chyme enters the small
intestine it will further undergo the
process of mechanical and
chemical digestion. The pancreatic
fluid contains enzymes that digest proteins, fats and carbohydrates. The pancreatic fluid also contains sodium bicarbonate, which
neutralizes the acid in the chyme, protecting the lining of the small intestine and enabling some enzymes to work. The bile secreted
in the liver breaks fat into smaller pieces. Digested molecules of food are absorbed through the _______5_____. The walls of the
small intestine contain many folds that are lined up with many tine finger-like protrusions called villi. These villi are in turn covered
with even smaller protrusions called microvilli. These structures increase the surface area through which nutrients are absorbed.
During______6____, these nutrients pass through the walls of the intestine and into the bloodstream where they get transported to
the different parts of the body.
After absorption, the next process is _______7_______ which is the movement of digested food molecules into the cells of
the body where they are used. For example: glucose is used in respiration to provide energy, and amino acids are used to build new
proteins. The liver is important in assimilation. For example, it converts glucose into glycogen (a complex carbohydrate used for
storage) and amino acids into proteins.
The small intestine absorbs most of the water in the contents of the gut. By the time the contents reach the end of the small
intestine, most of the digested food has also been absorbed.
The remaining material consists of: water bacteria (living and dead) cells from the lining of the gut indigestible substances -
such as cellulose from plant cell walls.
The colon is the first part of the______8_____. The large intestine reabsorbed the water from the remaining food in the digestive
tract and water-soluble vitamins are absorbed along with water. It absorbs most of the remaining water. This leaves semi-solid waste
material called______9_____. The feces are stored in the rectum, the last part of the large intestine. _____10_______ happens when
these feces pass out of the body through the anus.</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:Digestion is the process by which food and drink are broken down into their smallest parts so the body can use them to build and nourish cells and to provide energy.</strong></p><p><strong>The juices and the mashing help to break your food into smaller pieces.

                            21. Reflection About this short story
THE BLIND BUS PASSENGER
It had been a year since Susan, 34, became blind. Due to a medical
misdiagnosis she had been rendered sightless, and she was suddenly thrown
into a world of darkness, anger, frustration and self-pity. And all she had
to cling to was her husband, Mark.
Mark was an Army officer and he loved Susan with all his heart. When she
first lost her sight, he watched her sink into despair and was determined to
help his wife gain the strength and confidence she needed to become
independent again.
Finally, Susan felt ready to return to her job, but how would she get there?
She used to take the bus, but was now too frightened to get around the city
by herself. Mark volunteered to drive her to work each day, even though they
worked at opposite ends of the city. At first, this comforted Susan, and
fulfilled Mark's need to protect his sightless wife who was so insecure
about performing the slightest task. Soon, however, Mark realized the arrangement
wasn't working. Susan is going to have to start taking the bus again, he
admitted to himself. But she was still so fragile, so angry - how would she react?
Just as he predicted, Susan was horrified at the idea of taking the bus
again. "I'm blind!", she responded bitterly. "How am I supposed to know
where I am going? I feel like you're abandoning me."
Mark's heart broke to hear these words, but he knew what had to be done.
He promised Susan that each morning and evening he would ride the bus with
her, for as long as it took, until she got the hang of it.
And that is exactly what happened. For two solid weeks, Mark, military
uniform and all, accompanied Susan to and from work each day. He taught her
how to rely on her other senses, specifically her hearing, to determine
where she was and how to adapt to her new environment. He helped her
befriend the bus drivers who could watch out for her, and save her a seat.
Finally, Susan decided that she was ready to try the trip on her own.
Monday morning arrived, and before she left, she threw her arms around Mark,
her temporary bus-riding companion, her husband, and her best friend. Her
eyes filled with tears of gratitude for his loyalty, his patience, and his love.
She said good-bye, and for the first time, they went their separate ways.
Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday... Each day on her own went perfectly,
and Susan had never felt better. She was doing it! She was going to work all by herself.
On Friday morning, Susan took the bus to work as usual. As she was paying
the fare to exit the bus, the driver said, "Boy, I sure do envy you."
Susan wasn't sure if the driver was speaking to her or not. After all, who
on earth would ever envy a blind woman who had struggled just to find the
courage to live for the past year? Curious, she asked the driver, "Why do
you say that you envy me?"
The driver responded, "It must feel good to be taken care of and protected like you are."
Susan had no idea what the driver was talking about, and again asked, "What do you mean?"
The driver answered, "You know, every morning for the past week, a fine
looking gentleman in a military uniform has been standing across the corner
watching you as you get off the bus. He makes sure you cross the street
safely and he watches until you enter your office building. Then he blows
you a kiss, gives you a little salute and walks away. You are one lucky lady."
Tears of happiness poured down Susan's cheeks. For although she couldn't
physically see him, she had always felt Mark's presence. She was lucky, so
lucky, for he had given her a gift more powerful than sight, a gift she
didn't need to see to believe - the gift of love that can bring light where
there is darkness.</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>While reading this short story I had realized something in life. I had realized that not all things go as planned or as we thought it would. Like in the story wherein Susan had become blind and has been living in the darkness for a year. Although it hurts to accept it and we constantly ask ourselves why this happened to us we still tried to accept it and live normally because we know that the reason god had let this happen to us was because he had plans for us and for our well-being.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>sana po makatulong</p><br />
