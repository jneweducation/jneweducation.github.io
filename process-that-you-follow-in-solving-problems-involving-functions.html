                                            According to Alice Hoffman every problem has a solution. In finding the solution one important aspect to consider is the “how” or the process of finding it. In solving problems involving functions there are different process that we can employ to attain the solution.

                            21. in three to five sentences write the process that you follow in solving problems involving functions​</h2><br />
                        <p>Answer:</p><p></p><p>Step-by-step explanation:</p><p></p><p>As mentioned above, I use Polya’s four steps to problem solving to show students how to solve word problems.    Just note that your math teacher or math book may word it a little differently, but you will see it all basically means the same thing.</p><p>If you follow these steps, it will help you become more successful in the world of problem solving. </p><p>Polya created his famous four-step process for problem solving, which is used all over to aid people in problem solving: </p><p>Step 1: Understand the problem. </p><p> </p><p>Sometimes the problem lies in understanding the problem.  If you are unclear as to what needs to be solved, then you are probably going to get the wrong results.  In order to show an understanding of the problem, you, of course, need to read the problem carefully.  Sounds simple enough, but some people jump the gun and try to start solving the problem before they have read the whole problem.  Once the problem is read, you need to list all the components and data that are involved. This is where you will be assigning your variable.</p><p></p><p> </p><p>Step 2:  Devise a plan (translate). </p><p> </p><p>When you devise a plan (translate), you come up with a way to solve the problem.  Setting up an equation, drawing a diagram, and making a chart are all ways that you can go about solving your problem.  In this tutorial, we will be setting up equations for each problem.  You will translate them just like we did in Tutorial 2: Algebraic Expressions and Tutorial 5: Properties of Real Numbers.</p><p></p><p> </p><p>Step 3:  Carry out the plan (solve). </p><p> </p><p>The next step, carry out the plan (solve), is big. This is where you solve the equation you came up with in your 'devise a plan' step.  The equations in this tutorial will all be linear equations.  If you need help solving them, by all means, go back to Tutorial 7: Linear Equations in One Variable and review that concept.</p><p></p><p> </p><p>Step 4:  Look back (check and interpret). </p><p> </p><p>You may be familiar with the expression 'don't look back'.  In problem solving it is good to look back (check and interpret)..  Basically, check to see if you used all your information and that the answer makes sense.  If your answer does check out, make sure that you write your final answer with the correct labeling.</p><br />
