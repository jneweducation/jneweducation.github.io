My name is Aprille Arrivado, your chairman for today’s panel discussion. It is an honor both to participate in this event with our guests and to welcome you all. As we all know, our new normal today is somewhat strange to our usual way of living. In fact, one of the most affected systems in this time of crisis is our educational system. Everyone did not expect things to happen like this especially doing classes online, for face-to-face learning is strongly prohibited now to stop the spread of the coronavirus. We have invited you today to inform everyone especially the learners and their parents as well as our educators about online classes- how to do it effectively as a new means of teaching and learning and throughout the discussion, theywill identify the advantages and disadvantages of using this new method of teaching and learning.Thought-provoking Questions:1. _______________________________________2. _______________________________________3. _______________________________________4. _______________________________________5. _______________________________________​(NONSENSE=REPORT)​</a>

I was sitting in the class, surrounded by people taking notes and paying attention to how to do equations, which would have been okay if I was supposed to be in an algebra class. In reality, I was supposed to be in geometry, and when I discovered my error, I had already missed the first twenty minutes of a one-hour said, "You're late* That would have been bad enough, but in my next class my history teacher spoke so class When I got to the correct class, all twenty-five students turned and looked at me as the teacher fast I could not follow most of what they said. The only thing I did hear was that we were having a quiz tomorrow over today's lecture. My day seemed to be going better during botany class, that is, until we visited the lab. I had a sneezing fit because of one of the plants in the lab and had to leave the room When I finally finished my classes for the day, I discovered I had locked my keys in the car and had to wait for my brother to bring another set. My first day of school was so bad that I know the rest will have to be better.

As we all know, our new normal today is somewhat strange to our usual way of living. In fact, one of the most affected systems in this time of crisis is our educational system. Everyone did not expect things to happen like this especially doing classes online, for face-to-face learning is strongly prohibited now to stop the spread of the coronavirus. We have invited you today to inform everyone especially the learners and their parents as well as our educators about online and modular classes- how to do it effectively as a new means of teaching and learning and throughout the discussion, they will identify the advantages and disadvantages of using this new method of teaching and learning.Sana po may sumagot dinamihan kona po yung points​</a>

My name is Aprille Arrivado, your chairman for today’s panel discussion. It is an honor both to participate in this event with our guests and to welcome you all. As we all know, our new normal today is somewhat strange to our usual way of living. In fact, one of the most affected systems in this time of crisis is our educational system. Everyone did not expect things to happen like this especially doing classes online, for face-to-face learning is strongly prohibited now to stop the spread of the coronavirus. We have invited you today to inform everyone especially the learners and their parents as well as our educators about online classes- how to do it effectively as a new means of teaching and learning and throughout the discussion, theywill identify the advantages and disadvantages of using this new method of teaching and learning.Thought-provoking Questions:1. _______________________________________2. _______________________________________3. _______________________________________4. _______________________________________5. _______________________________________​(NONSENSE=REPORT)​</h2><br />

The only thing I did hear was that we were having a quiz tomorrow over today's lecture. My day seemed to be going better during botany class, that is, until we visited the lab. I had a sneezing fit because of one of the plants in the lab and had to leave the room When I finally finished my classes for the day, I discovered I had locked my keys in the car and had to wait for my brother to bring another set. My first day of school was so bad that I know the rest will have to be better.

It is an honor both to participate in this event with our guests and to welcome you all. As we all know, our new normal today is somewhat strange to our usual way of living. In fact, one of the most affected systems in this time of crisis is our educational system.
