He began to search his father's importantpapers and saw the still new Bible, just as he had left it few years ago. With tears, he opened the Bible and began to turn pages. Ashe read those words, a car key dropped from an envelope taped behind the Bible. It had a tag with the dealer's name, the same dealerwho had the sports car he had desired.

B. Most of us, regardless of age, buy gifts for loved ones and friends during special occasions. This practice of gift-giving may be traced from Biblical times. However, some tend to give expensive gifts in return of future favors. The need to share with those who are in need is becoming a lesser priority.

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>A young man was getting ready to graduate from college. For many months he had admired a beautiful sports car in a dealer’s showroom, and knowing that his father could well afford it, he told him that was all he wanted.
</p><p>
</p><p>As Graduation Day approached the young man awaited signs that his father had purchased the car for him. Finally on the day he was to graduate his father called him into his private study, told him how proud he was to have such a fine son and how much he loved him. He then handed him a beautifully wrapped gift box.
</p><p>
</p><p>Curious, but somewhat disappointed the young man opened the box and found a lovely leather bound Bible with his name embossed on it in gold. He was angry so he raised his voice to his father and said, "With all of your money you give me a Bible rather than the sports car I wanted.” He then stormed out of the house leaving the Bible behind.
</p><p>
</p><p>Many years passed and the young man was very successful in the business he went in. He had a beautiful home and a wonderful family but realized when he thought about his father that he was very old. He then decided that perhaps he should go to see him because he had not seen him since that graduation day.
</p><p>
</p><p>However, before he could make arrangements to go he received a phone call from a funeral home director telling him that his father had passed away and had willed all of his possessions to him. He was told that he needed to come home immediately and take care of things.
</p><p>
</p><p>When the son arrived at his father’s house sadness and regret filled his heart. He began to search through his father’s important documents and saw the Bible his father had given him for graduation. The Bible looked new just as it was years ago when he was given it.
</p><p>
</p><p>With tears in his eyes he opened the Bible and began to turn through the pages. His father had carefully underlined a verse which was Matthew 7:11 which reads, "And if ye being evil know how to give good gifts to your children how much more shall your Heavenly Father which is in Heaven give to those who ask Him.”
</p><p>
</p><p>As the son read those words a car key dropped from the back of the Bible. It had a tag on it with the car dealer’s name, the same dealer who had the sports car that he wanted so badly for his college graduation. On the tag was the date of his graduation and the words written in large print "PAID IN FULL.”
</p><p>
</p><p>Many times during our lifetime we miss God’s blessings because they are not packaged as we expected them to be.
</p><p>
</p><p>If this true story has touched your heart and you have a son or daughter graduating from high school or college this year give them what they want if you can afford it but also give them a Bible as well with their name engraved on the front of it.
</p><p>
</p><p>Graduates, may I tell you what opportunity is and when it knocks. Opportunity will never knock. You can wait your entire life listening and hoping that the right opportunity for you will knock, but rest assured that it will not knock.
</p><p>
</p><p>You are a high school or college graduate now and you are opportunity and you must knock on the door that you wish will lead you to where you wish to go in life.
</p><p>
</p><p>By graduating you have prepared yourself to recognize the opportunity you wish to pursue so siege that opportunity as you develop the strength of your personality and build a self-image with which you are able to live with.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p></p><br />
