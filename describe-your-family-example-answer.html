                                            Step 1
Be specific about the decision to be made.
Step 2
Check your options.
Process Example
Identify a list of situations where a
decision needs to be made.
• Decisions are made based on a
variety of factors, experience,
knowledge, and emotions.
• Some decisions need to be made
before the situation. For example,
Washing your hands with soap and
water before eating.
• Important decisions should be made
thoughtfully.
I am invited to a birthday party of my
bestfriend in the middle of this
pandemic. I asked permission from my
parents but they won’t allow me to go.
What should I do?
I don’t want to hurt my bestfriend for not
attending her birthday party.
I also don’t want to disobey my parents
because, at my age, I am not allowed to
go out of our house during this
pandemic.
So, I will call my bestfriend and tell her
honestly my decision of not going to her
birthday party ahead of time.
Process Example
Make a list of all of the possible options
to consider in a situation.
The following questions may help you
guide your thinking:
• Is the option healthy or unhealthy?
• How does this option affect me?
• How does this option affect others?
My options are to:
1. I could ask my best friend to talk to
my parents about her birthday party.
Outcomes, positive, I get to understand
that by going out of the house during
this pandemic, I may be able to affect
the health of my family as well as mine.
2. I can still attend her birthday party
through virtual presence.
3. My family and I are safe at home.
9
Step 3
Assess your capacity to decide.
Step 4
Make a decision and follow through.
Step 5
Describe the outcome of the decision.
Process Example
After identifying options and outcomes,
distinguish between the decisions you
can make by yourself and the decisions
with which you need help.
Consider the following questions:
• Are you having trouble coming
up with healthy options?
• Is your safety or someone else’s
safety at risk?
• Are you feeling uncomfortable
with your options?
Based on the answer to these
questions, do you need to ask a trusted
adult or refer to another resource for
help?
•I feel safe and secure with this
decision.
•I can also feel comfortable with the
healthy options that I have my family
with me at home and safe.
•I can say that I made this decision on
my own.
Process Example
You are now ready to make a decision
based on your analysis of the positive
and negative outcomes.
I chose the option that is best and
healthy both for my family and my
bestfriend during this pandemic.
Process Example
Describe the outcome of the decision
and determine if the outcome was
positive or negative for others and
yourself.
I told my parents about my decision of
telling my best friend that I am not
allowed to attend her birthday party for
now because of the pandemic.
The outcome was positive
because my parents saw my courage to
tell me best-friend about my health
option for my family and my best friend
too.

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Economic prospects have diverged further across countries since the April 2021 World Economic Outlook (WEO) forecast. Vaccine access has emerged as the principal fault line along which the global recovery splits into two blocs: those that can look forward to further normalization of activity later this year (almost all advanced economies) and those that will still face resurgent infections and rising COVID death tolls. The recovery, however, is not assured even in countries where infections are currently very low so long as the virus circulates elsewhere.</p><p></p><p> </p><p></p><p>The global economy is projected to grow 6.0 percent in 2021 and 4.9 percent in 2022.The 2021 global forecast is unchanged from the April 2021 WEO, but with offsetting revisions. Prospects for emerging market and developing economies have been marked down for 2021, especially for Emerging Asia. By contrast, the forecast for advanced economies is revised up. These revisions reflect pandemic developments and changes in policy support. The 0.5 percentage-point upgrade for 2022 derives largely from the forecast upgrade for advanced economies, particularly the United States, reflecting the anticipated legislation of additional fiscal support in the second half of 2021 and improved health metrics more broadly across the group.</p><p></p><p> </p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>From ancient times, China has been the dominant and referential culture in East Asia. Although variously developed Neolithic cultures existed on the Korean Peninsula and on the Japanese archipelago, archaeological evidence in the form of worked stone and blades from the Paleolithic and Neolithic periods suggests an exchange between the early East Asian cultures and the early introduction of Chinese influence. This cultural interaction was facilitated in part by land bridges that connected Japan with the continent.</p><p></p><p>Significant developments in the production of earthenware vessels from as early as 14,000 BCE in Japan (thus far, the world’s earliest dated pottery) and from approximately 3500 BCE in Korea are well documented. They reveal a rich symbolic vocabulary and decorative sense as well as a highly successful union of function and dynamic form. These types of vessels chronicle the increasing needs for storage as there was a gradual societal transformation from nomadic and foraging cultures to more sedentary crop-producing cultures. There were pottery-dominant cultures in China as well. The painted (c. 5000 BCE) and black (c. 2500 BCE) earthenware are the best known.</p><p></p><p>As Korea and Japan continued in various Neolithic phases, developments in China from approximately 2000 BCE were far more complex and dramatic. Archaeological evidence firmly corroborates the existence of an emerging bronze culture by approximately 2000 BCE. This culture provided the base for Shang dynasty (c. 1600–1046 BCE) culture, which witnessed extraordinary developments in the production of bronze, stone, ceramic, and jade artifacts as well as the development of a pictograph-based written language. Bronze production and the expansion of rice cultivation gradually appeared in Korea from approximately 700 BCE and then slightly later in Japan. While no single political event seemed to further the transmission of Chinese cultural elements to Korea and Japan, clearly the expansionist policies of the rulers of the Han dynasty (206 BCE–220 CE) stimulated what had been a gradual assimilation of Chinese cultural elements by both Korea and Japan. Indicatively, it is from this period that Chinese documentation of legation visits to Japan provide the first written records describing the structure of Japanese society.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>hope it helps</p><p></p><br />

                            27. Step 1
Be specific about the decision to be made.
Step 2
Check your options.
Process Example
Identify a list of situations where a
decision needs to be made.
• Decisions are made based on a
variety of factors, experience,
knowledge, and emotions.
• Some decisions need to be made
before the situation. For example,
Washing your hands with soap and
water before eating.
• Important decisions should be made
thoughtfully.
I am invited to a birthday party of my
bestfriend in the middle of this
pandemic. I asked permission from my
parents but they won’t allow me to go.
What should I do?
I don’t want to hurt my bestfriend for not
attending her birthday party.
I also don’t want to disobey my parents
because, at my age, I am not allowed to
go out of our house during this
pandemic.
So, I will call my bestfriend and tell her
honestly my decision of not going to her
birthday party ahead of time.
Process Example
Make a list of all of the possible options
to consider in a situation.
The following questions may help you
guide your thinking:
• Is the option healthy or unhealthy?
• How does this option affect me?
• How does this option affect others?
My options are to:
1. I could ask my best friend to talk to
my parents about her birthday party.
Outcomes, positive, I get to understand
that by going out of the house during
this pandemic, I may be able to affect
the health of my family as well as mine.
2. I can still attend her birthday party
through virtual presence.
3. My family and I are safe at home.
9
Step 3
Assess your capacity to decide.
Step 4
Make a decision and follow through.
Step 5
Describe the outcome of the decision.
Process Example
After identifying options and outcomes,
distinguish between the decisions you
can make by yourself and the decisions
with which you need help.
Consider the following questions:
• Are you having trouble coming
up with healthy options?
• Is your safety or someone else’s
safety at risk?
• Are you feeling uncomfortable
with your options?
Based on the answer to these
questions, do you need to ask a trusted
adult or refer to another resource for
help?
•I feel safe and secure with this
decision.
•I can also feel comfortable with the
healthy options that I have my family
with me at home and safe.
•I can say that I made this decision on
my own.
Process Example
You are now ready to make a decision
based on your analysis of the positive
and negative outcomes.
I chose the option that is best and
healthy both for my family and my
bestfriend during this pandemic.
Process Example
Describe the outcome of the decision
and determine if the outcome was
positive or negative for others and
yourself.
I told my parents about my decision of
telling my best friend that I am not
allowed to attend her birthday party for
now because of the pandemic.
The outcome was positive
because my parents saw my courage to
tell me best-friend about my health
option for my family and my best friend
