Meterstick, tape measure, and sturdy rope are some of the standard tools in measuring distance. TrueFalse23. The measure of how far or near two points are from one another is called distance. TrueFalse24. The metric system of measurement of distance is used only in the Philippines. TrueFalse25. Using different units of measurement may lead to misunderstanding and confusion among people. TrueFalse26. Ten kilometers is equal to 1,000 meters. TrueFalse27. Speed can be calculated by multiplying the distance covered by an object in motion by the amount of time it used to cover the distance. TrueFalse28.
