Next, the job supervisor estimates time and materials for the job. This is a time-consuming process, and delays are common. Then, the job is schedule for a specific day and estimated time. On the day, the job is to be work on, materials orders have to be issue to stores. If materials are not available, the order has to be reschedule. Time cards are completed in the shop when workers fulfill the work order. These time cards are also use to charge back time to the customer. Time cards are process by hand, and the final calculations are enter on the work order. The work orders are checked for accuracy and sent to CIS, where accounting records will be update and the customer is billed. The problem is that the customer frequently calls to inquire on costs already incurred on a work order, but it's not possible to respond because CIS sends a report of all work orders only once a month. The management has no idea of how good initial estimates are or how much work is being done on any tool or machine, or by any worker. QUESTION: Evaluate the scenarios above. Identify the problem causes, effect and solution to the problem.​</a>

The machine being used for the operation has a bookvalue and a market value of zero. However, the machine is in good working order andwill last at least another 10 years. The proposed replacement machine will perform theoperation so much more efficiently that Chang’s engineers estimate that it will produceafter-tax cash flows (labor savings and depreciation) of $9,000 per year. The new machinewill cost $40,000 delivered and installed, and its economic life is estimated to be 10 years.It has zero salvage value. The firm’s WACC is 10%, and its marginal tax rate is 35%.

On the day, the job is to be work on, materials orders have to be issue to stores. If materials are not available, the order has to be reschedule. Time cards are completed in the shop when workers fulfill the work order. These time cards are also use to charge back time to the customer. Time cards are process by hand, and the final calculations are enter on the work order. The work orders are checked for accuracy and sent to CIS, where accounting records will be update and the customer is billed. The problem is that the customer frequently calls to inquire on costs already incurred on a work order, but it's not possible to respond because CIS sends a report of all work orders only once a month. The management has no idea of how good initial estimates are or how much work is being done on any tool or machine, or by any worker. QUESTION: Evaluate the scenarios above. Identify the problem causes, effect and solution to the problem.​</a>

What are the items which you consider to be weaknesses or areas for improvement? What words which are neutral or factual, such as "5 feet 4 inches tall, 120 pounds"? Do some categories have more minus than plus areas? The larger proportion of minus to plus areas you have, the more effort will be needed to achieve positive self-esteem. If the vast majority of your minus responses are in one or two areas, your self-esteem is likely to be good but has a few self-estimates which need to be improved. Name some ways in which you can improve the minus areas and further enhance the positive aspects.#CARRYONLEARNING❤️​</a>

                                            3. The fastest way to move forward is by running after your starting phase has been done. If you're tall or have a long step, you'll only need to take one or two steps before reaching the center of the court; i.e., your base position and two more steps would take you to the forecourt if required. Whatever be the number of steps that you need, always move forward with good posture and hold your racket in the ready position. Don't forget in too much excitement of game that when you are dealing with a shuttle in the forecourt, it is the racket head that needs to make contact and not you! Therefore, you don't have to bring your entire body into the forecourt area. You should estimate when to stop so that one final step in the hitting position will take you forward.​</a>

                                            1. Operating costs - These include expenses like salaries of employees, rentals, insurance, light and water payments. Operating costs are also called overhead costs. These are expenses that are needed before a business can run 2. Selling costs - These include expenses like delivery charges, transportation expenses, mail and others. 3. Owner's profits - The owner must receive a profit from his business for personal use. This is a reward or payment for his efforts to keep the business going. These expenses must be computed or estimated and added to the cost of goods for sale to determine their selling price. This is called the mark-on or gross profit. Mark On = Selling Price - Cost For example, if Carlo decides to sell for P100 each the T-shirts he bought for P75 how much will be the mark-on or profit? Selling Price = P100 Cost of Goods for Sale/Sold = P75 Mark On = Selling Price - Cost P100-P75 = P25 Carlo has a mark-on or gross profit of P25 for every t-shirt sold Will the whole P25 go to him as his personal profit. No. Remember that there are three basic expenses that must be considered. The selling cost, operational cost and owner's profit. Only after he has alloted an amount to cover the selling and operational costs can he take whatever's left as owner's profit.​</a>

On the day, the job is to be worked on, materials orders have to be issued to stores. If materials are not available, the order has to be rescheduled.
Time cards are completed in the shop when workers fulfill the work order. These time cards are also used to chargeback time to the customer. Time cards are process by hand, and the final calculations are enter on the work order. The work orders are checked for accuracy and sent to CIS, where accounting records will be update and the customer is billed.
The problem is that the customer frequently calls to inquire on costs already incurred on a work order; but it's not possible to respond because CIS sends a report of all work orders only once a month. The management has no idea of how good initial estimates are or how much work is being done on any tool or machine, or by any worker.

Time cards are completed in the shop when workers fulfill the work order. These time cards are also use to charge back time to the customer. Time cards are process by hand, and the final calculations are enter on the work order. The work orders are checked for accuracy and sent to CIS, where accounting records will be update and the customer is billed. The problem is that the customer frequently calls to inquire on costs already incurred on a work order, but it's not possible to respond because CIS sends a report of all work orders only once a month. The management has no idea of how good initial estimates are or how much work is being done on any tool or machine, or by any worker. QUESTION: Evaluate the scenarios above. Identify the problem causes, effect and solution to the problem.​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>4.1 Historical Perspective</p><p>Good project management in construction must vigorously pursue the efficient utilization of labor, material and equipment. Improvement of labor productivity should be a major and continual concern of those who are responsible for cost control of constructed facilities. Material handling, which includes procurement, inventory, shop fabrication and field servicing, requires special attention for cost reduction. The use of new equipment and innovative methods has made possible wholesale changes in construction technologies in recent decades. Organizations which do not recognize the impact of various innovations and have not adapted to changing environments have justifiably been forced out of the mainstream of construction activities.</p><p></p><p>Observing the trends in construction technology presents a very mixed and ambiguous picture. On the one hand, many of the techniques and materials used for construction are essentially unchanged since the introduction of mechanization in the early part of the twentieth century. For example, a history of the Panama Canal construction from 1904 to 1914 argues that:</p><p></p><p>[T]he work could not have done any faster or more efficiently in our day, despite all technological and mechanical advances in the time since, the reason being that no present system could possibly carry the spoil away any faster or more efficiently than the system employed. No motor trucks were used in the digging of the canal; everything ran on rails. And because of the mud and rain, no other method would have worked half so well. [1]</p><p></p><p>In contrast to this view of one large project, one may also point to the continual change and improvements occurring in traditional materials and techniques. Bricklaying provides a good example of such changes:</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><strong>hope it helps</strong><br />

What are the items which you consider to be weaknesses or areas for improvement? What words which are neutral or factual, such as "5 feet 4 inches tall, 120 pounds"? Do some categories have more minus than plus areas? The larger proportion of minus to plus areas you have, the more effort will be needed to achieve positive self-esteem. If the vast majority of your minus responses are in one or two areas, your self-esteem is likely to be good but has a few self-estimates which need to be improved. Name some ways in which you can improve the minus areas and further enhance the positive aspects.#CARRYONLEARNING❤️​</h2><br />

                            16. 3. The fastest way to move forward is by running after your starting phase has been done. If you're tall or have a long step, you'll only need to take one or two steps before reaching the center of the court; i.e., your base position and two more steps would take you to the forecourt if required. Whatever be the number of steps that you need, always move forward with good posture and hold your racket in the ready position. Don't forget in too much excitement of game that when you are dealing with a shuttle in the forecourt, it is the racket head that needs to make contact and not you! Therefore, you don't have to bring your entire body into the forecourt area. You should estimate when to stop so that one final step in the hitting position will take you forward.​</h2><br />

Direction: Analyze the situation, write the concept then justify your answer(why)Copy and answer 1.The company prepares financial reports are based on the SFAS promulgated by the ASC. 2. The assets and owner's equity are reported at fair value but business obligations are reported at historical cost. 3. The company maintains only one employee to function as accountant, internal auditor, collector and treasurer. 4. The financial reports are always delayed. 5.

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>slayed slay slay slay slay slay slay slay</p><p></p><p>The situation described appears to be a case of poor accounting practices at Prospere General Merchandise. Here is my analysis and justification of each point:</p><p></p>The fact that the financial reports are based on SFAS promulgated by the ASC is a positive sign, as it indicates that the company is following generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP).Reporting assets and owner's equity at fair value but business obligations at historical cost is not necessarily a problem, as this is a common practice in accounting. However, it may be worth examining the company's specific reasoning for this choice.The fact that the company has only one employee serving as accountant, internal auditor, collector, and treasurer is a red flag. It is highly unlikely that this individual has the necessary skills and expertise to perform all of these roles effectively, which could lead to errors, fraud, or other issues.The consistent delay of financial reports suggests that the company lacks a proper accounting system or process. This could indicate a lack of organization, resources, or commitment to financial transparency.Reporting estimated future earnings in the current financial reports is not acceptable under GAAP, as financial statements are meant to reflect past performance and current conditions, not future projections.Changing accounting methods and procedures regularly can create confusion and inconsistency in financial reporting, which can make it difficult for stakeholders to understand the company's performance and financial position.Recording transactions without proper supporting documents is a serious breach of accounting ethics and can lead to inaccurate financial reporting.While minutes of meetings, business contracts, and future plans may not be financial in nature, they can provide important context and insight into the company's operations and performance.Refusing to be audited by an external auditor is a red flag, as it suggests a lack of transparency and accountability. While having an internal auditor is important, an external audit provides an objective and independent review of the company's financial reporting.Depreciating a refillable pen over five years is not a material error, but it is an indication that the company may not have a clear understanding of accounting principles and the concept of materiality.<br />

                            26. 1. Operating costs - These include expenses like salaries of employees, rentals, insurance, light and water payments. Operating costs are also called overhead costs. These are expenses that are needed before a business can run 2. Selling costs - These include expenses like delivery charges, transportation expenses, mail and others. 3. Owner's profits - The owner must receive a profit from his business for personal use. This is a reward or payment for his efforts to keep the business going. These expenses must be computed or estimated and added to the cost of goods for sale to determine their selling price. This is called the mark-on or gross profit. Mark On = Selling Price - Cost For example, if Carlo decides to sell for P100 each the T-shirts he bought for P75 how much will be the mark-on or profit? Selling Price = P100 Cost of Goods for Sale/Sold = P75 Mark On = Selling Price - Cost P100-P75 = P25 Carlo has a mark-on or gross profit of P25 for every t-shirt sold Will the whole P25 go to him as his personal profit. No. Remember that there are three basic expenses that must be considered. The selling cost, operational cost and owner's profit. Only after he has alloted an amount to cover the selling and operational costs can he take whatever's left as owner's profit.​</h2><br />

                            29. The manager of a tool and die shop needs help with job processing and control. Jobs are currently processed by hand. First, a job number is established. Next, the job supervisor estimates time and materials for the job. This is a time-consuming process, and delays are common. Then, the job is scheduled for a specific day and estimated time.
On the day, the job is to be worked on, materials orders have to be issued to stores. If materials are not available, the order has to be rescheduled.
Time cards are completed in the shop when workers fulfill the work order. These time cards are also used to chargeback time to the customer. Time cards are process by hand, and the final calculations are enter on the work order. The work orders are checked for accuracy and sent to CIS, where accounting records will be update and the customer is billed.
The problem is that the customer frequently calls to inquire on costs already incurred on a work order; but it's not possible to respond because CIS sends a report of all work orders only once a month. The management has no idea of how good initial estimates are or how much work is being done on any tool or machine, or by any worker.
