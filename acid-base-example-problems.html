Write your answer on a sheet of paper.In biology, a mutation simply changes in DNA or is an alteration of the nucleotide sequence of the genome of an organism, the DNA and RNA are both nucleic acid, therefore anything can be altered not only in plants, animals, fungi, protist, bacteria, or viruses or especially a covid19 virus.However, are you wondering why a man has distinct features or same characteristics features like a down syndrome and there’s a lot of genetic disorder that occurs like Turner syndrome, Klinefelter syndrome and other disorder?There are two types of mutation, gene mutation, and chromosome mutation. Gene mutation is an alteration of the nucleotide sequence. It includes a substitution which means wrong bases matched, an insertion which means an extra base, and deletion which means a base removed. These may have a potentially dangerous effect when they happened. Another type of mutation is a chromosome mutation in which the structure and number are altered. An example of this is duplication, deletion, inversion, and translocation. In duplication, the extra copies are generated while in deletion thegenetic materials break off, in inversion the chromosome inverse and translocationa fragment chromosome break off and attached to another chromosome. The mutation might happen by some factors. It can be external factors like certain chemicals, or some radiations and internal factors which an event that causes a problem in the DNA replication.pahelp naman po​</a>

Write your answer on a sheet of paper.In biology, a mutation simply changes in DNA or is an alteration of the nucleotide sequence of the genome of an organism, the DNA and RNA are both nucleic acid, therefore anything can be altered not only in plants, animals, fungi, protist, bacteria, or viruses or especially a covid19 virus.However, are you wondering why a man has distinct features or same characteristics features like a down syndrome and there’s a lot of genetic disorder that occurs like Turner syndrome, Klinefelter syndrome and other disorder?There are two types of mutation, gene mutation, and chromosome mutation. Gene mutation is an alteration of the nucleotide sequence. It includes a substitution which means wrong bases matched, an insertion which means an extra base, and deletion which means a base removed. These may have a potentially dangerous effect when they happened. Another type of mutation is a chromosome mutation in which the structure and number are altered. An example of this is duplication, deletion, inversion, and translocation. In duplication, the extra copies are generated while in deletion thegenetic materials break off, in inversion the chromosome inverse and translocationa fragment chromosome break off and attached to another chromosome. The mutation might happen by some factors. It can be external factors like certain chemicals, or some radiations and internal factors which an event that causes a problem in the DNA replication.pahelp naman po​</h2><br />
