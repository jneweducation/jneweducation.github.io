                                            Task 5Read the following paragraph and answer the questions that follow.The book is a valuable resource as it provides interesting theoretical and methodological means for analyzing news discourse. For instance, analyzing the combination of images and texts allows greater understanding of values encoded in the news. In addition, the book adequately discusses means for addressing methodological problems in analyzing data in different forms of media. Moreover, since the book draws on different perspectives, readers will find a range of options to work with when confronting their own data. To illus trate, news may not only be seen on the national/international scene but also in specific locales. Therefore, this can help in making sense of one's data through adequate examples.The book is intended as a suitable introduction for graduate students and researchers interested in exploring the complexities of news discourse, as it provides input, a list of readings and additional activities for research. It also integrates several theoretical and methodological perspectives, giving readers o free hand on deciding which approach to employ in analyzing their own data, Overall, this book, which is part of the Continuum series of books covering areas of discourse, is a valuable contribution for the enrichment of scholarship concerning news discourse (Valdez, 2014).Guide Questions:1 Is the recommendation of the book positive or negative? Cite specific information.2. What considerations did the author mention for readers to consider in reading the book?​</a>

For instance, analyzing the combination of images and text allows greater understanding of values encoded in the news. In addition, the book adequately discusses means for addressing methodological problem in analyzing data in different forms of media. Moreover, since the book draws on different perspective, readers will find a range of option to work with when confronting their own data. To illustrate, news may not only be seen on the national/international scene of one’s data through adequate examples.The book is intended as a suitable introduction for graduate students and researchers interested in exploring the complexities of news discourse, as integrates several theoretical and methodological perspectives, giving readers a freehand on deciding which approach to employ in analyzing their own data.

research reports, opinion articles, and summaries of clinical issues, pertinent questions may arise
in our mind
4. If an existing theory is used in developing a researchable problem, a specific statement from the
theory must be isolated.
5. Brainstorming sessions are good techniques to find new questions, where an intensified
discussion among interested people of the profession is conducted to find more ideas to formulate
a good research problem.
6. Day-to-day practical experience of a researcher may serve as a good source of ideas to formulate
a research problem.
