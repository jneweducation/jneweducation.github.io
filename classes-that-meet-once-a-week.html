cause-effect. On the space provided before the number, put a ( / ) if the text is a

1. There are many reasons why our class goes to the library once a week for what
we call “Book Hour.” For one, our teacher has observed that many of us read
poorly when asked to read aloud a story or poem in class. Another reason is
that most of us at home have an Internet provider. As a result, our teacher has
noticed that the home research we submit are lifted from online references.
When our teacher checked our borrowings from the library, most of us have
not brought home a storybook or reference related to the different subjects.
Thus, for many weeks now, we get to hold books and do our readings for an
hour in the library.
2. If you are looking for fun this summer, what better place to go but to our newly
renovated Splash Kingdom! It has everything you want---swimming pool for
kids and adults, different amusement rides, games, billiards, videoke, other
forms of entertainment, and wonderful facilities for you to enjoy. For sports

3. Air pollution may be due to a lot of factors, the most common of which are
caused by exhaust gases from vehicles, factory gas emissions, and natural
events. Exhaust gases from vehicles have continuously dominated the air,
especially in highly urbanized towns, cities, mainly because the government
lacks control and citizens prefer convenience to the harmful effects. Likewise,
the government has not exercised good control over the location of factories
that emit gas elsewhere. Most often than not, air pollution is caused by natural
events such as forest fires, volcanic eruptions, wind erosion and pollen
dispersal.
4. Both reading books at home and going on vacation are fun. Through reading,
you meet new people and see new places at less expense. When you don’t feel
like interacting with your new friends you just stop reading. Going on vacation
gives you the opportunity to meet new people in the flesh and see new places
with your eyes but you have to spend much more for your fare, your food, and
the entrance tickets to the tourist spots. Besides, when your newfound friends
become bothersome, you cannot get away from them easily.
5. The water shortage that hit the country lately causes several problems.
Because of water shortage, public places like local restaurants and many other
places are forced to use very little water for cleaning which causes huge
sanitation issues. In household settings, clean drinking water is also hard to
acquire. Lack of water also results in clogged sewage, a perfect breeding place
for mosquitoes and other insects---the sources of dengue, malaria, and other
diseases. In rural areas, growing of plants becomes a hard job because of less
irrigation, which leads to a shortage in crops like rice.</a>

places are forced to use very little water for cleaning which causes huge
sanitation issues. In household settings, clean drinking water is also hard to
acquire. Lack of water also results in clogged sewage, a perfect breeding place
for mosquitoes and other insects---the sources of dengue, malaria, and other
diseases. In rural areas, growing of plants becomes a hard job because of less
irrigation, which leads to a shortage in crops like rice.</h2><br />
