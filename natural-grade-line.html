Now that you're older, you decide who your friends are and what groups you spend time with. Your friends your peers are people your age or close to it who have experiences and interests similar to yours. You and your friends make dozens of decisions every day, and you influence each other's choices and behaviors. This is often positive    - it's human nature to listen to and learn from other people in your age group. As you become more independent, your peers naturally play a greater role in your life. As school and other activities take you away from home, you may spend more time with peers than you do with your parents and siblings. You'll probably develop close friendships with some of your peers, and you may feel so connected to them that they are like an extended family. Besides close friends, your peers include other kids you know who are in the same age         — like people in your grade, church, sports team, or community. These peers also influence you by the way they dress and act, things they're involved in, and the attitudes they show. It's natural for people to identify with and compare themselves to their peers as they consider how they wish to be (or think they should be), or what they want to achieve. People are influenced by peers because they want to fit in, be like peers they admire, do what others are doing, or have what others have. -________________________________Reflect on the following pressing questions about violence in the media and write your answers on the space provided. 1.based on the text, who are the people which are considered as your peers?

The number of these tiny particles may be larger. Naked eyes can’t see these extremely tiny particles. Atoms can only be observed with the help of high- powered microscope. The following is the nature of matter :<br /><br />Atoms that have protons, neutrons, electrons and a nucleus consist of matter.<br />It generally exists in four states i.e. liquid, solid, gaseous and plasma state.<br />The universe itself is a matter.<br />Not all forms of energy are matter. For example, heat, sound, electricity, etc.<br />What we see, hear, feel, touch or taste is matter.<br />It occupies space and has its own mass.<br />We can classify matter on the basis of physical properties and chemical properties. Liquids, gases and solids come under the physical properties. Crystalline and amorphous form are two forms of solids.<br />Chemical properties of matter are classified on the basis of mixtures and pure substances. The homogenous and heterogeneous mixture are the two classifications of mixtures. Whereas, pure substances classify further into elements and compounds. Organic substances and inorganic substances are two forms of compounds and metals and non – metals are two forms of elements.<br />Different kinds of matter have different kinds of atoms.<br />All matters have their own density and inertia.<br />The force of attraction between the particles of matter is the interparticle force or the intermolecular force.<br />

Tulong po thank You 3 day until dead line po tulong po help po Nonsense = reportCarefully read an excerpt of the article, Peer Pressure published by Kids Health Organization_______________________________ When you were a little kid, your parents usually chose your friends, putting you in play groups or arranging play dates with certain children they knew and liked. Now that you're older, you decide who your friends are and what groups you spend time with. Your friends your peers are people your age or close to it who have experiences and interests similar to yours. You and your friends make dozens of decisions every day, and you influence each other's choices and behaviors. This is often positive    - it's human nature to listen to and learn from other people in your age group. As you become more independent, your peers naturally play a greater role in your life. As school and other activities take you away from home, you may spend more time with peers than you do with your parents and siblings. You'll probably develop close friendships with some of your peers, and you may feel so connected to them that they are like an extended family. Besides close friends, your peers include other kids you know who are in the same age         — like people in your grade, church, sports team, or community. These peers also influence you by the way they dress and act, things they're involved in, and the attitudes they show. It's natural for people to identify with and compare themselves to their peers as they consider how they wish to be (or think they should be), or what they want to achieve. People are influenced by peers because they want to fit in, be like peers they admire, do what others are doing, or have what others have. -________________________________Reflect on the following pressing questions about violence in the media and write your answers on the space provided. 1.based on the text, who are the people which are considered as your peers? Why? Answer:__________________________________________________________2. What is your stand about the peer pressure? Do you think it healthy to feel pressured by your friends decisions and choices or is it harmful to your well-being to be persuaded among your peers about your decision and choices?
