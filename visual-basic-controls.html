Draw your illustration in your notebook.1.Almost all Koreans live in cities, which occupy only a small portion of thenation's total area. The country divides its land by use -- urban areas, managedareas, natural preserves, and farms and forests in order to carry out its planninginitiatives of the categories, urban areas take up 16.7 percent of the country, whilefarms and forests occupy 46.5 percent, followed by 25.6 percent for managed areasand 11.2 percent for preserves.2.South Korea and North Korea took dramatically different paths following theend of fighting in the Korean War in 1953. When it comes to their economies andliving standards, they could hardly be more different. The two Koreas are separatedby the demilitarized zone, a four-kilometer wide strip running along the 38th parallelwhich splits the Korean peninsula roughly in half. To the south of the DMZ, SouthKorea operates one of the world's most advanced economies, while to the north itsneighbor is a military dictatorship that keeps a tight fist on the economy and hasoften struggled to provide enough food to its people. North Korea's economy isisolated and tightly controlled. It is generally unable to meet the basic needs of itspeople. Economists find it difficult to analyze the North Korean economy becausedata is non-existent, unreliable, or outdated. South Korea's economy is one of theworld's most advanced and productive, ranking 12th globally in terms of annualoutput. South Korea's economic growth depends heavily on exports, and the nationleads the world in shipments of semiconductors and memory chips.PA ANSWER PO PLSSSS ​</a>

The country divides its land by use -- urban areas, managedareas, natural preserves, and farms and forests in order to carry out its planninginitiatives of the categories, urban areas take up 16.7 percent of the country, whilefarms and forests occupy 46.5 percent, followed by 25.6 percent for managed areasand 11.2 percent for preserves.2.South Korea and North Korea took dramatically different paths following theend of fighting in the Korean War in 1953. When it comes to their economies andliving standards, they could hardly be more different. The two Koreas are separatedby the demilitarized zone, a four-kilometer wide strip running along the 38th parallelwhich splits the Korean peninsula roughly in half. To the south of the DMZ, SouthKorea operates one of the world's most advanced economies, while to the north itsneighbor is a military dictatorship that keeps a tight fist on the economy and hasoften struggled to provide enough food to its people. North Korea's economy isisolated and tightly controlled. It is generally unable to meet the basic needs of itspeople. Economists find it difficult to analyze the North Korean economy becausedata is non-existent, unreliable, or outdated. South Korea's economy is one of theworld's most advanced and productive, ranking 12th globally in terms of annualoutput. South Korea's economic growth depends heavily on exports, and the nationleads the world in shipments of semiconductors and memory chips.PA ANSWER PO PLSSSS ​</h2><br />

There are two basic types of pattern in art. Natural and Man-Made pattem. 7. The angles and curves of shapes appear to change depending on our viewpoint. 8. The visual elements are line, share, tone, color, pettem, texture and form 9. The visual elements have a relationship to one another. 10. Line is the most basic visual element.​</h2><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>VB.NET Controls are the pillars that help in creating a GUI Based Applications in VB.Net quickly and easily. These are objects that you can drag to the Form using the Control toolbox in the IDE. Each VB.NET Control has some properties, events, and methods that can be used to tweak and customize the form to our liking.</p><p></p><br />

True or False. Write TRUE if the given statement states fact, otherwise write FALSE.
1. Controls make up the design of your form.
2. Controls are objects contained within form objects.
3. All programs made with Visual Basic are window programs with a graphical
user interface.
4. You can set form or control properties either by coding or using the
of the Properties Window.
5. Properties are attributes of forms and not controls.
6. A form is not an object.
7. The front-end side of an application is not the user interface.
8. Object properties have default values set by Visual Basic.
9. Once on the form, a control can no longer be repositioned.
10. Objects do not have similar properties.</h2><br />
