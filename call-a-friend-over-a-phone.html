                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>ELEMENTS OF THE COMMUNICATION PROCESS
</p><p>There are seven important elements of the communication process. Here are the details:
</p><p>
</p><p><strong>SENDER</strong>
</p><p>The process of communication starts with the sender. This is the entity that will use the means of communication to share her thoughts. The sender starts the communication cycle by deciding to convey her thoughts and chooses the format to use.
</p><p>
</p><p>The sender manages her thoughts, seeks clarity and decides what exactly she wants to put forth. The sender needs to gather the required information and relevant ideas in order to communicate. For example, a writer begins with an idea and transforms it into a book.
</p><p>
</p><p>ENCODING
</p><p>Encoding is the step in the process of communication where the sender decides how she wants to convey her thoughts. Selecting the right words, associated symbols in verbal communication or gestures, tones and sounds in nonverbal communication are ways of encoding a thought.
</p><p>
</p><p>To make encoding easier, it is imperative to know who is the receiver.  </p><p>
</p><p>MESSAGE
</p><p>A message is formed after the sender decides what she wants to put forth and how she wants to convey it. It’s also known as encoding. The nature of the message can change depending on the medium you use and the audience for which it is meant. Always remember that for communication to be successful, it is important that the listener or reader understands the message.
</p><p>  </p><p>    CHANNEL OR MEDIUM
</p><p>In order to better explain the process of communication, one has to pay close attention to one crucial wheel of this cycle, which is the medium. </p><p>
</p><p>
RECEIVER
</p><p>The process of communication is incomplete without a receiver to ‘lend an ear’. Whenever a sender writes, or says or sings or expresses anything, it’s meant to be read, or experienced. The receiver is a crucial part of this process.
</p><p>
</p><p>The receiver gathers the information presented or broadcasted by the sender and begins to understand it. We take turns between being a sender and being a receiver. You are a receiver when you watch a movie, and a sender when you tell your friends how the movie was.
</p><p>
</p><p><strong>DECODING</strong>
</p><p>No matter how well the message is crafted (or encoded), it will fail to make an impact if the receiver does not possess the tools to decode the message.  </p><p>
</p><p>While growing up, we also build the ability to decode various messages. Even if the word ‘beautiful’ has one meaning in all the dictionaries, globally, it would undoubtedly mean something different to different people. We decode any message by our own mechanisms, thoughts, memories and create our own meaning.
</p><p>
</p><p>FEEDBACK
</p><p>The process of communication is a long one. Communication does not stop after a thought or idea is expressed or a sentence or a word is uttered. It creates ripples through time, like a stone slung in a peaceful lake. Feedback is one of the last stages of communication.
</p><p>
After a message is encoded, sent over a medium received, and decoded, there is a need for the communication to keep moving. Through feedback, the receiver becomes the sender, broadcasting the views about the information received.
</p><p>
</p><p>The Communication model used is Schramm's Model
</p><p>Schramm  emphasized in 1954 that both the sender and the receiver take turns playing the role of the encoder and the decoder when it comes to communication.</p><p>The illustration is provided below!</p><p>#BrainlyFast </p><p>
