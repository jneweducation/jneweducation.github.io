Motion takes place when an object is at rest.A only Bil only C. I and I D. II and IV2. Which obiect does NOT demonstrate motion?A Aball rolling on the floorB. A ballerina dancing on the stageC. Mother walking on the streetPencil on the table3. When do you say that an object has moved?A.When the object is stationaryB. When the object changes its sizeC. When the object has a lubricantD.When the object changes its position in relation to a point of reference4.While sitting on a wooden chair, you push a heavy table and your chair movesbackward. Which statement explains this?A Objects in motion tend to remain in motion.B. Objects at rest tend to remain at rest.C. For every action, there is an equal and opposite reactionD.

                                            What is It
How can we say that an object is in motion? How do we describe the motion of an object? These are few questions to encounter in studying motion and constructing and interpreting visual representations of moving objects. There are few misconceptions to correct: 
1.Motion is not relative. 
2.Distance and displacement mean the same thing. 
3.Speed and velocity mean the same thing. 
4.When the object is moving, it is accelerating.</a>

                                            Did you get the correct answers? Find out.You know that something has moved because you can see that it has changed position. Position is the locationof an object. It is an object's distance and direction from a reference point. A reference point, also called frame ofreference, is the starting point you choose to describe where the object is. The car in the first activity has changedposition when it was a meter away from the trees. This process of changing an object's position is called motionWhat to do:Watch and listen to the video presentation posted inyour GCGuide Questions:1. What have you seen in the video presented?2.

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>1. What happens according to Newton if you let an untied balloon go?
</p><p>3
</p><p>rd Law
</p><p>Air will rush out of the balloon forcing the balloon to move through the air in
</p><p>the opposite direction, but equal in force.
</p><p>2. Describe what happens if you are riding a skateboard and hit something (like
</p><p>a curb) with the front wheels.
</p><p>1
</p><p>st Law
</p><p>Your body will keep moving forward and fly off your skateboard since the
</p><p>curb only stops the board, not yourself.
</p><p>3. Describe what happens if you try and push Mr. Larson. What happens if he
</p><p>pushes back?
</p><p>2
</p><p>nd Law
</p><p>If you put force on Mr. Larson, force will be put back on you. Because of
</p><p>Mr. Larson’s mass, you most likely will not have enough force to make him
</p><p>accelerate. If Mr. Larson pushed you, you most likely would move in the
</p><p>direction of the force since he has more mass.
</p><p>4. Describe why you hold your gun next to your shoulder while deer hunting.
</p><p>3
</p><p>rd
</p><p>Law
</p><p>When you pull the gun’s trigger, it forces the bullet out of the gun, but at
</p><p>the same time, the gun is forced in the opposite direction of the bullet
</p><p>(towards you). Your shoulder is a new force that is introduced in order to
</p><p>keep your gun from flying away from you.
</p><p>5. What is another name for the first law of motion? Why is it given that
</p><p>name?
</p><p>Law of inertia.  </p><p>It is given that name because inertia is the tendency of an object to resist
</p><p>any change in its motion until an unbalanced force acts on it. That is the
</p><p>same thing that Newton’s first law states.
</p><p>6. Why should we wear seatbelts – use one of Newton’s Laws in your answer?
</p><p>We should wear seatbelts so if we are in an accident our body doesn’t keep
</p><p>moving at the same speed and in the same direction that the car was going.
</p><p>A new force would be introduced to our bodies (the seatbelt) in order to
</p><p>keep our bodies in place.
</p><p>7. Using Newton’s laws explain why heavier objects require more force than
</p><p>lighter objects to move or accelerate them?
</p><p>2
</p><p>nd Law
</p><p>Something with more mass moving at the same acceleration as a lighter
</p><p>object would require more force to change its speed or change its direction.
</p><p>Our formula F=m x a is derived from Newton’s second law.
</p><p>8. How can Newton’s laws be used to explain how rockets are launched into
</p><p>space?
</p><p>Newton’s third law would tell us that when the rocket pushes out fire with a
</p><p>specific amount of force, the rocket will move in the opposite direction, but
</p><p>with the same amount of force. This is what causes the rocket to shoot up
</p><p>into the air.
</p><p>9. Explain how each of Newton’s laws affects a game of Tug of War.
</p><p>First Law: The rope will stay in the same place until the tugging starts (a new
</p><p>force is introduced)
</p><p>Second Law: We could measure a team’s force that they can pull the rope
</p><p>with based on their body masses and the acceleration that they are causing
</p><p>the rope to move at.
</p><p>Third: 1 team pulls the rope towards themselves with a certain amount of
</p><p>force and the opposing team is also putting force on the rope. The same
</p><p>amount of force is applied from the ground to the people as they are putting
</p><p>on the ground.
</p><p>10. How do Newton’s laws affect your daily life?
</p><p>Answers will vary, but EVERYTHING that happens in our lives can be
</p><p>connected back to one of Newton’s 3 laws of motion since force is involved in
</p><p>everything.</p><p></p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p>an object is moving if its position relative to a fixed point is changing. Even things that appear to be at rest move. When we describe the motion of one object with respect to another, we say that the object is moving relative to the other object.You can describe the motion of an object by its position, speed, direction, and acceleration. An object is moving if its position relative to a fixed point is changing. Even things that appear to be at rest move.Everything naturally wants to move and change. In the world of mechanics, there are four basic types of motion. These four are rotary, oscillating, linear and reciprocating.<p>hope it's help</p><p>#CarryOnLearning</p><br />

                            14. What is It
How can we say that an object is in motion? How do we describe the motion of an object? These are few questions to encounter in studying motion and constructing and interpreting visual representations of moving objects. There are few misconceptions to correct: 
1.Motion is not relative. 
2.Distance and displacement mean the same thing. 
3.Speed and velocity mean the same thing. 
4.When the object is moving, it is accelerating.</h2><br />

It is an object's distance and direction from a reference point. A reference point, also called frame ofreference, is the starting point you choose to describe where the object is. The car in the first activity has changedposition when it was a meter away from the trees. This process of changing an object's position is called motionWhat to do:Watch and listen to the video presentation posted inyour GCGuide Questions:1. What have you seen in the video presented?2.

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>1.An object is moving if its position relative to a fixed point is changing. Even things that appear to be at rest move. When we describe the motion of one object with respect to another, we say that the object is moving relative to the other object.</p><p>2.There are 24 hours in a day. The day is divided into day(time) and night(-time). Daytime is from sunrise (this varies, but we can say approximately 6am) to sunset (we can say approximately 6pm).</p><p> Night-time is from sunset to sunrise</p><p>3.Rotation" refers to an object's spinning motion about its own axis. "Revolution" refers the object's orbital motion around another object. For example, Earth rotates on its own axis, producing the 24-hour day. Earth revolves about the Sun, producing the 365-day year.</p><p>4.In physics, a force is any interaction that, when unopposed, will change the motion of an object. A force can cause an object with mass to change its velocity (which includes to begin moving from a state of rest), i.e., to accelerate. Force can also be described intuitively as a push or a pull.</p><p></p><br />
