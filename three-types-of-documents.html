Kind of Proportion: ______________________
Solution:</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Step-by-step explanation:</strong></p><p>For the first problem, the type of proportion being involved is DIRECT. It can be solved using the formula: </p><p>Time taken = (Number of words/Words per minute)</p><p>For the given problem, </p><p>Time taken = (1260/45) = 28 minutes.</p><p></p><p>For the second problem, the type of proportion being involved is PARTITIVE. It can be solved using the formula: </p><p>Number of computers = (Total number of computers/Sum of ratio) x Number in the ratio</p><p>For the given problem, </p><p>Number of computers for each elementary school = (1090/10) x 2 = 218,</p><p>Number of computers for each elementary school = (1090/10) x 3 = 327,</p><p>Number of computers for each elementary school = (1090/10) x 5 = 545.</p><p></p><br />
