</p><p></p><p>4.You might guess that the greater the acceleration of, say, a car moving away from a stop sign, the greater the car’s displacement in a given time. But, we have not developed a specific equation that relates acceleration and displacement. In this section, we look at some convenient equations for kinematic relationships, starting from the definitions of displacement, velocity, and acceleration. We first investigate a single object in motion, called single-body motion. Then we investigate the motion of two objects, called two-body pursuit problems.
</p><p>
</p><p>Notation
</p><p>First, let us make some simplifications in notation. Taking the initial time to be zero, as if time is measured with a stopwatch, is a great simplification. Since elapsed time is  </p><p>Δ
</p><p>t
</p><p>=
</p><p>t
</p><p>f
</p><p>−
</p><p>t
</p><p>0
</p><p>, taking  </p><p>t
</p><p>0
</p><p>=
</p><p>0
</p><p> means that
</p><p>Δ
</p><p>t
</p><p>=
</p><p>t
</p><p>f
</p><p>, the final time on the stopwatch. When initial time is taken to be zero, we use the subscript 0 to denote initial values of position and velocity. That is,  </p><p>x
</p><p>0
</p><p> is the initial position and  </p><p>v
</p><p>0
</p><p> is the initial velocity. We put no subscripts on the final values. That is, t is the final time, x is the final position, and v is the final velocity. This gives a simpler expression for elapsed time,  </p><p>Δ
</p><p>t
</p><p>=
</p><p>t
</p><p>. It also simplifies the expression for x displacement, which is now  </p><p>Δ
</p><p>x
</p><p>=
</p><p>x
</p><p>−
</p><p>x
</p><p>0
</p><p>. Also, it simplifies the expression for change in velocity, which is now  </p><p>Δ
</p><p>v
</p><p>=
</p><p>v
</p><p>−
</p><p>v
</p><p>0
</p><p>. To summarize, using the simplified notation, with the initial time taken to be zero,
</p><p>
</p><p>Δ

</p><p>t
</p><p>Δ

</p><p>v
</p><p>−
</p><p>v
</p><p>0
</p><p>,
</p><p>where the subscript 0 denotes an initial value and the absence of a subscript denotes a final value in whatever motion is under consideration.
</p><p>
</p><p>We now make the important assumption that acceleration is constant. This assumption allows us to avoid using calculus to find instantaneous acceleration. Since acceleration is constant, the average and instantaneous accelerations are equal—that is,

                        <p> The car's initial velocity is 0 km/hr since it starts from rest.

Using the formula vf^2 = vi^2 + 2ad, where vf is the final velocity, vi is the initial velocity, a is the acceleration, and d is the distance traveled, we can solve for the acceleration: </p><p></p><p>vf^2 = vi^2 + 2ad </p><p></p><p>20^2 = 0^2 + 2a(150) </p><p></p><p>400 = 300a </p><p></p><p>a = 1.33 m/s^2 </p><p></p><p>Therefore, the acceleration of the train is 1.33 m/s^2. </p><p></p><p>2. Using the formula vf^2 = vi^2 + 2ad, where vf is the final velocity (0 m/s), vi is the initial velocity, a is the acceleration (-8.0 m/s^2), and d is the distance traveled (484 m), we can solve for the initial velocity: </p><p></p><p>0^2 = vi^2 + 2(-8.0)(484) </p><p></p><p>vi^2 = 7744 </p><p></p><p>vi = 88 m/s </p><p></p><p>Therefore, the initial velocity of the car was 88 m/s. </p><p></p><p>3.

Scalar quantities have only magnitude (size) and no direction, while vector quantities have both magnitude and direction.</p><p></p><p>2. Uniform motion refers to the motion of an object with constant speed in a straight line, while uniform accelerated motion refers to the motion of an object with constant acceleration in a straight line. In uniform motion, velocity is constant, while in uniform accelerated motion, velocity changes at a constant rate.</p><p></p><p>3. The sign of acceleration indicates the direction of the acceleration.

Free fall motion occurs when an object is falling under the influence of gravity alone, without any other forces acting upon it. Some scenarios that can illustrate free fall motion include dropping an object from a height, throwing an object vertically upwards, and jumping from a height.</p><p></p><p>5. The vertical and horizontal motion of a projectile are independent of each other because the forces acting on the projectile act separately in the vertical and horizontal directions. In other words, the projectile's horizontal motion is not affected by its vertical motion, and vice versa. This means that the projectile follows a curved path, known as a parabola, with a constant horizontal velocity and a changing vertical velocity due to the force of gravity.</p><p></p><p>III.</p><p>1.
