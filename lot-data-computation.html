                                            PROBLEM:
Trisha has a lot of pictures of varied sizes that she would like to frame. She decided
to go to “Happy Frames” that offers framing services to restore and to frame her pictures.
The store deals two types of frames – standard and expensive. The frames are offered in 
white and can be ordered in any color the customer requests. Assume that each frame is 
(1) one inch wide. The cost amount to color the frame is $0.15 per inch. The cost amount
of a standard frame is $0.10 per inch and amount of an expensive frame is $0.35 per 
inch. The cost amount of placing a paperboard after the picture is $0.04 for every square 
inch and the cost amount of placing glass on upper of the picture is $0.09 for every inch. 
The client can choose to place crowns on the edges, which amount costs $0.45 per 
crown. Create a java program that computes the user to input the following data and 
display the overall costs of edging the picture.
a. Pictures L, W and computes inches
b. Input frame types
c. If the pictures did clients wanted to make it colored
d. If the number of crowns did the user wanted to put</a>

3. Use high-contrast color arrangements so that your slides will be readable
4. Place no more than eight lines of text on a slide with no more than eight to ten words per line.
5. Display charts or graphs with many data. It is useful for the audience to see such things.
6. Rehearse your PowerPoint presentation several times. Make sure that can deliver it even without the presentation.
7. Use slides sparingly so that the audience will focus on you, not on the screen
8. Slides should be used synchronously with your speech to emphasize or to illustrate the product.
9. More interaction and motion on the screen will make the audience learn a lot.
10. Use a remote clicker to enable you to move farther away from the computer.</a>

Trisha has a lot of pictures of varied sizes that she would like to frame. She decided
to go to “Happy Frames” that offers framing services to restore and to frame her pictures.
The store deals two types of frames – standard and expensive. The frames are offered in 
white and can be ordered in any color the customer requests. Assume that each frame is 
(1) one inch wide. The cost amount to color the frame is $0.15 per inch. The cost amount
of a standard frame is $0.10 per inch and amount of an expensive frame is $0.35 per 
inch. The cost amount of placing a paperboard after the picture is $0.04 for every square 
inch and the cost amount of placing glass on upper of the picture is $0.09 for every inch. 
The client can choose to place crowns on the edges, which amount costs $0.45 per 
crown. Create a java program that computes the user to input the following data and 
display the overall costs of edging the picture.
a. Pictures L, W and computes inches
b. Input frame types
