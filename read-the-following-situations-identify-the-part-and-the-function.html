He noticed that one of the objective lens is  missing and the course adjustment knob is not working. The eyepiece lens is  also broken.</p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong>Objective Lens</strong> - Objective lenses are the major part of a microscope that is used for specimen visualization. These lenses have a magnification power of 40 to 100 times. There are about one to four objective lenses placed on one microscope, in that some are rare facing and others face forward.  Each lens has its own magnification power.</p><p><strong>Adjustment Knob</strong> - These are knobs that are used to focus the specimen under the microscope. There are two types of adjustment knobs; fine adjustment knobs and coarse adjustment knobs. </p><p><strong>Eye-piece Lens</strong> - Eyepiece or the ocular is the part used to look through the microscope. It is located at the top of a microscope. The standard magnification of this lens is 10 times with an optional eyepiece having magnifications from 5X – 30X. </p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong>SITUATION 2</strong></p><p>Liza and her group are observing a wet mount.

This is the part that connects the base, head, and the eyepiece tube of the microscope. It also gives support to the head of the microscope. Some high-quality microscopes have an articulated arm with more than one joint allowing more movement of the microscopic head for better viewing.</p><p>#BrainlyEveryday</p><p><strong></strong></p><p>
