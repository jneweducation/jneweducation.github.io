If plants reflect green light, then they must absorb red light (the opposite of green) and thus, grow faster under red lights. 19. The results of the experiment showed that green light was the least effective color for growing our plants, blue and red lights caused the greatest amount of growth. 20. (1) Plant specimen - Light colors Growth: (2) Yellow Hibiscus - Green light +9.4cm, Red light: +12.2cm, Blue light 11.9cm, (3) Golden Sage - Green light: +6.6cm, Red light: +8.1cm, Blue light: +7.1 cm. 21.

Using clear containers with measurement marks, I will compare the volume of a glass of water at room temperature with a glass of frozen water. 23. After consistent results, I found out that water increases in volume when it freezes. 24. (1) Container #1 – Water. 14.0 mL, Ice: 14.8 mL; (2) Container #2 - Water, 20.0 mL, Ice: 20.8 ml 25.

Thursday's additional cases do not include data from 6 laboratories that failed to submit their results on time.It is the 6th straight day that additional COVID-19 cases counted fewer than 2,000. The daily tally also included 96 additional COVID-related deaths, or a total of 11,673 fatalities.Meanwhile, total recoveries went up by 412 to 512,375.

                            6. ANSWER ME! In a one whole intermediate paper, answer the following question given below Determine whether the situation presented is mutually exclusive of not and find the probability of two events.(note: copy and answer) 1. A basket contains 6 chicos, 5 bananas, 4 mangoes, and a 5 guaras. A fruit is randomly selected from the basket What is the probability that it is banana or a mango? 2. A spinner is divided into 8 equal parts. If it will be span once, find the probability of spinning a factor of 6 or a multiple 3? 3. If you roll a die, what is the probability of getting an odd number or a number greater than 27 4. In this (new normal situation), nobody is allowed to go out without wearing a face mask. Mark has 15 disposable facemask 4 are red, 6 are blue and 5 are green. What is the probability that he will wear a red or a blue face mask today? 5. If a fair 6 sided die is rolled, find the probability that its face has a number greater than 2 or number less than 5​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>1. The situation is not mutually exclusive because there are fruits that are both bananas and mangoes. The probability of selecting a banana or a mango is the sum of their individual probabilities: (5/16) + (4/16) = 9/16.</p><p></p><p>2. The situation is not mutually exclusive because there are numbers that are both factors of 6 and multiples of 3. The probability of spinning a factor of 6 or a multiple of 3 is the sum of their individual probabilities: 2/8 + 2/8 = 1/2.</p><p></p><p>3. The situation is not mutually exclusive because there are odd numbers greater than 2 on a die. The probability of getting an odd number or a number greater than 2 is the sum of their individual probabilities: 3/6 + 3/6 = 1.</p><p></p><p>4. The situation is mutually exclusive because a facemask cannot be both red and blue at the same time. The probability of wearing a red or a blue face mask is the sum of their individual probabilities: (4/15) + (6/15) = 10/15 or 2/3.</p><p></p><p>5. The situation is not mutually exclusive because there are numbers that are both greater than 2 and less than 5 on a die. The probability of getting a number greater than 2 or a number less than 5 is the sum of their individual probabilities: 4/6 + 3/6 = 7/6, which is not a valid probability since it is greater than 1. Therefore, we need to subtract the probability of getting a number that is both greater than 2 and less than 5 (which is 1/6) from the sum of the individual probabilities: (4/6) + (2/6) - (1/6) = 5/6.</p><p><strong>Step-by-step explanation:</strong></p><p>pa brainliest po ☺️</p><br />

exclamation point (!).

In a one whole intermediate paper, answer the following question given below Determine whether the situation presented is mutually exclusive of not and find the probability of two events.(note: copy and answer) 1. A basket contains 6 chicos, 5 bananas, 4 mangoes, and a 5 gurras. A fruit is randomly selected from the basket What is the probability that it is banana or a mango? 2. A spinner is divided into 8 equal parts. If it will be span once, find the probability of spinning a factor of 6 or a multiple 3? 3. If you roll a die, what is the probability of getting an odd number or a number greater than 27 4. In this (new normal situation), nobody is allowed to go out without wearing a face mask. Mark has 15 disposable facemask 4 are red, 6 are blue and 5 are green. What is the probability that he will wear a red or a blue face mask today? 5. If a fair 6 sided die is rolled, find the probability that its face has a number or less​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>1. Not mutually exclusive. P(banana or mango) = P(banana) + P(mango) = 5/16 + 4/16 = 9/16.</p><p>2. Mutually exclusive. P(factor of 6 or multiple of 3) = P(factor of 6) + P(multiple of 3) = 1/8 + 2/8 = 3/8.</p><p>3. Not mutually exclusive. P(odd number or number &gt; 2) = P(odd number) + P(number &gt; 2) - P(odd number and number &gt; 2) = 3/6 + 3/6 - 1/6 = 5/6.</p><p>4. Not mutually exclusive. P(red or blue) = P(red) + P(blue) - P(red and blue) = 4/15 + 6/15 - 0 = 2/3.</p><p>5. Mutually exclusive. P(number or less) = P(number 1) + P(number 2) + P(number 3) + P(number 4) + P(number 5) + P(number 6) = 6/6 = 1.</p><p></p><br />

If plants reflect green light, then they must absorb red light (the opposite of green) and thus, grow faster under red lights. 19. The results of the experiment showed that green light was the least effective color for growing our plants, blue and red lights caused the greatest amount of growth. 20. (1) Plant specimen - Light colors Growth: (2) Yellow Hibiscus - Green light +9.4cm, Red light: +12.2cm, Blue light 11.9cm, (3) Golden Sage - Green light: +6.6cm, Red light: +8.1cm, Blue light: +7.1 cm. 21. Which color lights cause plants to grow more effectively? 22. Using clear containers with measurement marks, I will compare the volume of a glass of water at room temperature with a glass of frozen water. 23. After consistent results, I found out that water increases in volume when it freezes. 24. (1) Container #1 – Water. 14.0 mL, Ice: 14.8 mL; (2) Container #2 - Water, 20.0 mL, Ice: 20.8 ml 25.
