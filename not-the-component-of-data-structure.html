Quantitative research is not a scientific, experimental, or inductive manner of thinking. 2. A survey research is used to gather information from groups of people selecting and studying samples from population. 3. Quantitative research is costly because of the large number of respondents. 4. Experimental research is the systematic investigation of the nature of the relationships or associations between and among variables without necessarily investigating into casual reasons underlying them 5. Qualitative research uses structured research instruments like questionnaire to collect measurable characteristic of the respondents. 6. A large number of data are used to show trends, relationships, or differences among variables and is one of the weaknesses of quantitative research 7. Descriptive research is the design concerned with describing the nature, characteristics and components of the population or a phenomenon. 8. Reliable quantitative studies cannot be repeated to verify or confirm its correctness in another setting 9. Research allows you to directly make a conclusion without ample data gathered using a problem- solving technique. 10. Inquiry is closely linked with research because investigating or examining a phenomenon is how research is started.​</a>

It is types are by far the most commonly used type ofcapacitor being cheap and reliable and their loss factor is particularlylow although this is dependent on the exact dielectric in use.6. It means opposition to some action.7. It can be used to adjust circuit elements (such as volumecontrol or a lamp dimmer), or as sensing devices for heat, light,humidity, force, or chemical activity.8.

It is the negative electrode, the point of entry of electrons intoa device from an external circuit. It is also the terminal connected tothe positive point of the circuit.13.It is derived from “transresistor", meaning that it changesresistance.14. It is used to reduce current flow, adjust signal levels, to dividevoltages, bias active elements, and terminate transmission lines,among other uses.15.

Quantitative research is costly because of the large number of respondentsneeded and the number of questionnaires to be reproduced._2. A large number of data are used to show trends, relationships, or differencesamong variables and is one of the weaknesses of quantitative research.3. Reliable quantitative studies CANNOT be repeated to verify or confirm itscorrectness in another setting.4. Inquiry is closely linked with research because investigating or examining aphenomenon is how research is started.5. Quantitative research is NOT a scientific, experimental, or inductive mannerof thinking6. Research allows you to directly make a conclusion without ample datagathered using a problem-solving technique.7. Qualitative research uses structured research instruments like questionnairesto collect measurable characteristics of the respondents.8. Descriptive research is the design concerned with describing the nature,characteristics and components of the population or a phenomenon.9. Experimental Research is the systematic investigation of the nature ofrelationships, or associations between and among variables without necessarilyinvestigating into causal reasons underlying them10. A survey research is used to gather information from groups of people byselecting and studying samples chosen from a population.​</a>

Survey of Academic and General Reading in English ______1. On 8th February 1999, a survey was conducted among 16 overseas post-graduate students at the University of England. The purpose of the survey was to discover the reading habits in English of the students ______2. The survey was conducted by means of a questionnaire given to the students to complete. The first part of the questionnaire dealt with the type of reading and its frequency. The second section was concerned with newspapers: the type of items read and those that were read first. ______3. From the table of data, the most significant items are as follows. In the first section 81% of the students regularly read academic books" while 44% regularly read academic journals. Nothing else is read regularly or often by 40% or more of the students. The following comments can be made about the reading of newspapers, magazines and fiction. _______4. If any conclusions may be drawn from the data, they are, perhaps, as follows. Overseas students presumably have little time for general reading: most of their reading time is spent on books and journals on their own subject. Outside their studies, apart from reading news about their own country, international news, and news about Britain, they probably spend most time watching TV and listening to the radio.  ________5. /from Academic Writing Course by R.R.

It permits the flow of current when DC voltage is applied tothe cathode (negative terminal). The diode is its active stage. LED doesnot emit light when it is reversed-biased.5. It is types are by far the most commonly used type ofcapacitor being cheap and reliable and their loss factor is particularlylow although this is dependent on the exact dielectric in use.6. It means opposition to some action.7. It can be used to adjust circuit elements (such as volumecontrol or a lamp dimmer), or as sensing devices for heat, light,humidity, force, or chemical activity.8.

Survey of Academic and General Reading in English ______1. On 8th February 1999, a survey was conducted among 16 overseas post-graduate students at the University of England. The purpose of the survey was to discover the reading habits in English of the students ______2. The survey was conducted by means of a questionnaire given to the students to complete. The first part of the questionnaire dealt with the type of reading and its frequency. The second section was concerned with newspapers: the type of items read and those that were read first. ______3. From the table of data, the most significant items are as follows. In the first section 81% of the students regularly read academic books" while 44% regularly read academic journals. Nothing else is read regularly or often by 40% or more of the students. The following comments can be made about the reading of newspapers, magazines and fiction. _______4. If any conclusions may be drawn from the data, they are, perhaps, as follows. Overseas students presumably have little time for general reading: most of their reading time is spent on books and journals on their own subject. Outside their studies, apart from reading news about their own country, international news, and news about Britain, they probably spend most time watching TV and listening to the radio.  ________5. /from Academic Writing Course by R.R.

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>By planning carefully and following through on her daily and weekly goals, Crystal was able to fulfill one of her goals for the semester. Although her exam scores were not as high as she had hoped, her consistently strong performance on writing assignments tipped her grade from a B+ to an A−. She was pleased to have earned a high grade in one of the required courses for her major. She was also glad to have gotten the most out of an introductory course that would help her become an effective teacher.

</p><p>To do well in the post-secondary environment, it is important to stay focused on how your day-to-day actions determine your long-term success. You may not have defined your career goals or chosen a major yet. Even so, you surely have some overarching goals for what you want out of your studies to expand your career options, to increase your earning power, or just to learn something new. In time, you will define your long-term goals more explicitly.
