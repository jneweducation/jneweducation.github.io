Is a technique with provision to guarantee the inclusion in thesample of diverse elements in the population and to make sure that these diverseelements are taken into account in proportion in which they occur in the population._20. refers to a sample technique in which samples are obtained usingsome objective chance mechanism, thus involving randomization.21. Is a detailed outline of which measurements will be taken at whattimes, on which material, what manner, and by whom that support the purpose of ananalysis.22. This is a technique when there is no way of estimating theprobability that each element has of being included in the sample and no assurancethat every element has a chance of being included.23. also known as "the man on the street" interviews conductedfrequently by television news program to get quick reading of public opinion.24. Is the basic probability sampling design. The sample is selected intwo ways: by means of a table of random numbers or by using the lottery technique.25.

                                            Enchanted River by Ramonito I. CruzMadlum River can be found in Barangay Sibul, San Miguel, Bulacan. It runs along the foot of Mt. Manalmon which is a popular tourist spot for hikers and a favorite location for shooting films. The river is known as a historical site for it is a part of the Biak na Bato National Park. The park is considered one of the UNESCO World Heritage Sites in the Philippines because of its preserved natural beauty from time immemorial. Also, the river boasts towering limestone cliffs, rock formations, and unspoiled clean water suitable for nature lovers making it a preferred side trip location for mountaineers and trekkers alike. Moreover, it is also famous for a couple of adventures such as crossing the river via a bamboo raft or through a hanging bridge and diving from the cliffs for those who like a little more extreme experience.However, it also has its shares of mystery to tell over the years. Notwithstanding her unquestionable beauty that attracts visitors; countless incidences of drowning have been recorded and became the talk of the town, spreading even up to its neighboring towns within the province. People believed that the river is taking lives every year for the river is inhabited also by unseen elements who are not of this world. According to hearsays, the river is possessed by some sort of evil spirits. Thus, everyone who wishes to visit the place must be cautious not to disturb these unseen entities for it might cost the sightseer his own life. A mystery that those who love thrill and adventure combined cannot resist exploring and experiencing for themselves.Fact:________________Opinion:_______________Fallacy:_________________pahelp po bukas na po yung pasahan​</a>

                                            4 The Origin of This World (Maranao) from the Anthology of Philippine Myths by Damiana L. Eugenio According to Maranaw folklore, this world was created by a great Being. It is not known, however, who exactly is this great Being. Or how many days it took him to create this world. This world is divided into seven layers. The earth has also seven layers. Each layer is inhabited by a different kind of being. The uppermost layer, for example, is the place we are inhabiting. The second layer is being inhabited by dwarfs. These dwarfs are short, plump, and long-haired. They are locally known as Karibanga. The Karibanga are said to possess magical powers. They are usually invisible to the human eye. The third layer of the earth which is found under the sea or lake is inhabited by nymphs. These nymphs also possess certain magical powers. It is stated in the story of Rajah Indarapatra that he met and fell in love with the princess nymph with whom he had a child. The sky also consists of seven layers. Each layer has a door which is guarded day and night by huge mythical birds called garoda. The seventh layer of the sky is the seat of heaven which is also divided into seven layers. Every layer in the sky is inhabited by angels. Maranaws believe that angels do not need food. They all possess wings with which they fly. Heaven which is found on the seventh layer of the sky is where good people's spirits go after death. Saints are assigned to the seventh layer while persons who -barely made it are confined to the lower most layer which is found at the bottom of heaven. It is in heaven where we find the tree-of-life. On each leaf of the tree-of- life is written the name of every person living on earth. As soon as a leaf ripens or dries and falls, the person whose name it carries also dies. The soul of every person is found in tightly covered jars kept in one section of heaven. This particular section of heaven is closely guarded by a monster with a thousand eyes, named Walo. Walo, in addition to his thousand eyes, has also eight hairy heads. The epic Darangan speaks of Madale, Bantugan's brother and, Mabaning, Husband of Lawanen, entering this section and retrieving the soul of Bantugan.1. How is this version of creation different from the version that you already know?2. Who, according to this selection, is the creator of the world?3. Is the number seven a significant element in this story of creation? Why or Why not?4. What is the significance of the tree of life in the story?5. Do sinners have a place in heaven? Which part of the story explains this?6. What does the retrieval of Bantugan's soul strongly say about the Maranao's belief aboutlife and death?Plsss I need help ​</a>

Smoking is among the worst habits so many people suffer from. It just makes the smokers live worse and worse for the so many drawbacks it has. First, Smoking badly affects our health as it destroys it gradually by the diseases it causes. To illustrate, throat cancer, chest cancer and lips cancer are among the most well-known cancers that the majority of smokers do suffer from nowadays. Second, all the smokers do waste more and more money on the cigarettes they smoke every now and then. For instance, ordinary smokers usually suffer from social problems and obstacles. For example, all smokers are considered disturbing elements wherever and whenever they are as they annoy the other non-smokers by their smoke. Consequently, a lot of people try to avoid them and get away from them. Smokers risk their lives because of the serious dangers that smoking causes. 1. Topic Sentence 2.

Some elements placed in the same sub-group had different properties. He could arrange elements only up to calcium out of the total 56 elements known after which the elements did not show similar properties. No fixed position could be given to hydrogen in the table as it resembled alkali metals as well as halogens.<p></p><strong>Henry Moseley</strong>: Believed that the atomic mass of the element was the most fundamental property in classifying the elements.

He arranged the elements in order of increasing atomic mass and noticed that every eighth element had similar properties.<p></p><strong>Dmitri Ivanovich Mendeleev</strong>: Arranged the known elements in the increasing order of their atomic masses and their properties. He found that every eighth element had properties similar to that of the first.

He arranged the elements in order of increasing atomic number and found that this arrangement led to a clearer pattern of periodicity than arranging them in order of increasing atomic mass. This became known as the modern periodic table.<br />

Manalmon which is a popular tourist spot for hikers and a favorite location for shooting films. The river is known as a historical site for it is a part of the Biak na Bato National Park. The park is considered one of the UNESCO World Heritage Sites in the Philippines because of its preserved natural beauty from time immemorial. Also, the river boasts towering limestone cliffs, rock formations, and unspoiled clean water suitable for nature lovers making it a preferred side trip location for mountaineers and trekkers alike. Moreover, it is also famous for a couple of adventures such as crossing the river via a bamboo raft or through a hanging bridge and diving from the cliffs for those who like a little more extreme experience.However, it also has its shares of mystery to tell over the years. Notwithstanding her unquestionable beauty that attracts visitors; countless incidences of drowning have been recorded and became the talk of the town, spreading even up to its neighboring towns within the province. People believed that the river is taking lives every year for the river is inhabited also by unseen elements who are not of this world. According to hearsays, the river is possessed by some sort of evil spirits. Thus, everyone who wishes to visit the place must be cautious not to disturb these unseen entities for it might cost the sightseer his own life. A mystery that those who love thrill and adventure combined cannot resist exploring and experiencing for themselves.Fact:________________Opinion:_______________Fallacy:_________________pahelp po bukas na po yung pasahan​</h2><br />

                            26. 4 The Origin of This World (Maranao) from the Anthology of Philippine Myths by Damiana L. Eugenio According to Maranaw folklore, this world was created by a great Being. It is not known, however, who exactly is this great Being. Or how many days it took him to create this world. This world is divided into seven layers. The earth has also seven layers. Each layer is inhabited by a different kind of being. The uppermost layer, for example, is the place we are inhabiting. The second layer is being inhabited by dwarfs. These dwarfs are short, plump, and long-haired. They are locally known as Karibanga. The Karibanga are said to possess magical powers. They are usually invisible to the human eye. The third layer of the earth which is found under the sea or lake is inhabited by nymphs. These nymphs also possess certain magical powers. It is stated in the story of Rajah Indarapatra that he met and fell in love with the princess nymph with whom he had a child. The sky also consists of seven layers. Each layer has a door which is guarded day and night by huge mythical birds called garoda. The seventh layer of the sky is the seat of heaven which is also divided into seven layers. Every layer in the sky is inhabited by angels. Maranaws believe that angels do not need food. They all possess wings with which they fly. Heaven which is found on the seventh layer of the sky is where good people's spirits go after death. Saints are assigned to the seventh layer while persons who -barely made it are confined to the lower most layer which is found at the bottom of heaven. It is in heaven where we find the tree-of-life. On each leaf of the tree-of- life is written the name of every person living on earth. As soon as a leaf ripens or dries and falls, the person whose name it carries also dies. The soul of every person is found in tightly covered jars kept in one section of heaven. This particular section of heaven is closely guarded by a monster with a thousand eyes, named Walo. Walo, in addition to his thousand eyes, has also eight hairy heads. The epic Darangan speaks of Madale, Bantugan's brother and, Mabaning, Husband of Lawanen, entering this section and retrieving the soul of Bantugan.1. How is this version of creation different from the version that you already know?2. Who, according to this selection, is the creator of the world?3.

Also, these axioms refer to basic 
set theory that you learned in Discrete Math. For our purposes, we will assume all of those 
 basic set theory terms are known. It is possible to view set theory itself as another

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>1. By Axiom 3, there exists at least one ant. Since, by Axiom 1, every ant has at least two paths, then there exists at least one path.</p><p></p><p></p><p><strong>Step-by-step explanation:</strong></p><p>By Axiom 3, there exists an ant. Let us call this ant A1. So by Axiom 1, A1 must have two paths, say P1 and P2. Hence, there are at least two paths. By Axiom 2, path P1 must have an ant other than A1, say A2. By Axiom 1, A2 must have another path, say P2. So we have a model where ants A1 and A2 are both assigned to paths P1 and P2. Axiom 1 is satisfied since A1 and A2 each have both P1 and P2. Axiom 2 is satisfied since P1 and P2 each have both A1 and A2.</p><p></p><p>– Axiom 3 is satisfied since we have two ants. Hence we have exactly two paths</p><br />

Smoking is among the worst habits so many people suffer from. It just makes the smokers live worse and worse for the so many drawbacks it has. First, Smoking badly affects our health as it destroys it gradually by the diseases it causes. To illustrate, throat cancer, chest cancer and lips cancer are among the most well-known cancers that the majority of smokers do suffer from nowadays. Second, all the smokers do waste more and more money on the cigarettes they smoke every now and then. For instance, ordinary smokers usually suffer from social problems and obstacles. For example, all smokers are considered disturbing elements wherever and whenever they are as they annoy the other non-smokers by their smoke. Consequently, a lot of people try to avoid them and get away from them. Smokers risk their lives because of the serious dangers that smoking causes. 1. Topic Sentence 2.
