Before, an audio can be created and transmitted through tape, radio, or CD. Today, a different alternative is offered by the Internet - the podcast. You may have encountered the term in your previous lesson in Listening Strategies. It is a digital audio file that is posted on the Internet. For you to practice the guidelines in conducting an interview, interview an expert on any field (Example: teacher, nurse, engineer, etc.). Imagine you will produce a 5-minute informative podcast about your interviewee's expertise 1. First, copy and accomplish the template on "Interview Plan" in your paper. Then, provide the interviewee with a copy of the interview questions to allow him/her to prepare answers. Remember to use open-ended questions. (Example: What advice would you give someone who like to follow a similar career to yours?) Interview Plan Interviewer Purpose of interview: Interviewee:Information I know about the Interviewee: Job Position/Title: Workplace: Years in service/practice: Others: Possible Questions: 1. 2.3.4.5.Answers:1.2.3.4.5.2. If a smartphone or any sound recorder is available, you can use it to record the interview. You can use your recording to complete the last part of your Interview Plan where you will write your interviewee's answers. Remember to use a direct speech or write the exact answers of your interviewee. 3. After the interview, reflect on the questions that follow. Write your answers on your paper. ►► What was it like to interview someone? ►►Which of the tips or guidelines did you use, and how did it help you as an interviewer? ►► GOOD AND HELPFUL ANSWER = BRAINLIEST ►►NONSENSE ANSWER = REPORT!! ​</a>

                        <p>Throughout our midterms in Purposive Communication I've already learned a lot of things not just only in speaking but in writing as well because of essay and/or blog. I express myself by unlocking my skills in explaining my thoughts and writing with a purpose as well.  Explanation essay help me to answer clearly the "why" questions in my topic which clearly explained my point about it.  Another thing connected to essay is the argumentative which also help me to think critically because you should defend something maybe you are pro's/cons or agree and disagree about a certain point.  Lastly, the interview with a foreigner which helps us to communicate to other people especially different citizen, because it can break some misunderstanding or miscommunication between the two individual. In communication it is important to understand every person with different cultures, beliefs, traditions or even way of life in order for us to have a good conversation with a person/individual.</p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Self-Confidence and Performance</p><p>Self-confidence is considered one of the most influential motivators and regulators of behavior in people's everyday lives (Bandura, 1986). A growing body of evidence suggests that one's perception of ability or self-confidence is the central mediating construct of achievement strivings (e.g., Bandura, 1977; Ericsson et al., 1993; Harter, 1978; Kuhl, 1992; Nicholls, 1984). Ericsson and his colleagues have taken the position that the major influence in the acquisition of expert performance is the confidence and motivation to persist in deliberate practice for a minimum of 10 years.</p><p></p><p>Self-confidence is not a motivational perspective by itself. It is a judgment about capabilities for accomplishment of some goal, and, therefore, must be considered within a broader conceptualization of motivation that provides the goal context. Kanfer (1990a) provides an example of one cognitively based framework of motivation for such a discussion. She suggests that motivation is composed of two components: goal choice and self-regulation. Self-regulation, in turn, consists of three related sets of activities: self-monitoring, self-evaluation, and self-reactions. Self-monitoring provides information about current performance, which is then evaluated by comparing that performance with one's goal. The comparison between performance and goal results in two distinct types of self-reactions: self-satisfaction or -dissatisfaction and self-confidence expectations. Satisfaction or dissatisfaction is an affective response to past actions; self-confidence expectations are judgments about one's future capabilities to attain one's goal. This framework allows a discussion of self-confidence as it relates to a number of motivational processes, including setting goals and causal attributions.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>sa wekapidea kopo yan kinuha basahin nyo nalang po</p><p></p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p></p><p>Purposive communication is a type of communication that is intentional, goal-oriented, and aimed at achieving specific objectives. It involves the use of language, symbols, and other forms of communication to convey a message that is meant to influence the thoughts, feelings, or actions of the receiver. The concept of purposive communication was discussed in detail during the midterm discussion, and I learned a lot about its importance and how it can be used effectively.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>One of the key things that I learned about purposive communication is that it is essential for achieving success in various fields, including business, politics, and social activism. In these areas, effective communication is crucial for influencing people's opinions, gaining support, and achieving goals. For example, a business leader who wants to persuade investors to invest in their company must use purposive communication to convey a message that highlights the company's strengths and potential for growth. Similarly, a politician who wants to win an election must use purposive communication to persuade voters to support their campaign.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>Another important aspect of purposive communication that I learned about is the need to tailor the message to the audience. Different audiences have different needs, interests, and values, and effective communication requires an understanding of these differences. For example, a social activist who wants to raise awareness about a particular issue must use language and symbols that resonate with the target audience.

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>In the preliminary discussion about purposive communication, I have learned about the importance of effective communication in achieving our goals and objectives. Purposive communication is a type of communication that focuses on achieving specific outcomes or objectives. It involves planning, organizing, and delivering a message in a way that is clear, concise, and understandable to the intended audience.</p><p></p><p>One of the key takeaways from the discussion is the role of context in purposive communication. The context refers to the environment or situation in which the communication takes place. It includes the physical setting, social norms, cultural values, and other factors that can influence the meaning and interpretation of the message. To communicate effectively, it is important to consider the context and adapt the message accordingly. For example, when communicating with people from different cultures or backgrounds, it is important to be sensitive to their values and beliefs and adjust the message to avoid misunderstandings or misinterpretations.</p><p></p><p>Another important aspect of purposive communication is the use of language. The language we use can greatly influence how our message is perceived and understood by others. It is important to use language that is appropriate for the audience, clear, and concise. We should avoid using jargon, technical terms, or complicated language that can confuse or alienate the audience. We should also consider the tone of our message and ensure that it is respectful, courteous, and professional.</p><p></p><p>Furthermore, the discussion highlighted the importance of feedback in purposive communication. Feedback allows us to assess the effectiveness of our communication and make necessary adjustments. By soliciting feedback from the audience, we can identify areas for improvement and adjust our communication strategy accordingly.</p><p></p><p>In terms of qualities that make a good communicator, I have learned that it is important to be clear, concise, and confident when delivering a message. A good communicator should be able to convey their message in a way that is easily understood and engaging to the audience. They should also be able to adapt their communication style to suit the needs of the audience and the context. Good communicators are also active listeners, which means they are able to receive and interpret feedback from the audience and make necessary adjustments to their message.</p><p></p><p>In conclusion, the preliminary discussion on purposive communication has been very informative and insightful. It has highlighted the importance of effective communication in achieving our goals and objectives, and the key factors that contribute to successful communication. It has also emphasized the importance of adapting our communication style to suit the needs of the audience and the context. As a learner, I am now more aware of the qualities that make a good communicator, and I will strive to develop these qualities in my own communication style.</p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Throughout the midterm discussion on purposive communication, I have gained a deeper understanding of how communication should be used to fulfill a specific purpose. From learning about the different components of effective communication to the various contexts in which it is used, I have come to appreciate the significance of communication in our daily lives.</p><p></p><p>Firstly, I have learned that effective communication involves several key elements such as sender, receiver, message, and feedback. These aspects work together to ensure that the intended message is conveyed accurately and received as intended. Additionally, I have come to understand the importance of tailoring the message to suit the audience, considering their age, cultural background, and social status, among other factors.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, I have learned about the various contexts in which communication is used, such as in interpersonal communication, public speaking, and group communication. In each context, there are unique communication skills required to achieve the desired purpose. For instance, in public speaking, one needs to be skilled in articulating their thoughts and capturing the attention of the audience. The importance of nonverbal cues, such as body language and tone, has also been emphasized, as they can convey additional meaning to the intended message.</p><p></p><p>Another critical aspect of communication that I have learned is the significance of purpose in communication. In purposive communication, the aim is to achieve specific goals or objectives, such as persuading, informing, or entertaining. This means that communication should be planned and executed in a way that best suits the intended purpose. For instance, when seeking to persuade, it is essential to use persuasive language, emotional appeals, and logical arguments to achieve the desired outcome.</p><p></p><p>Furthermore, the role of technology in communication has been highlighted. In today's digital age, communication has significantly evolved with the use of various social media platforms, instant messaging apps, and email communication. However, despite the convenience and ease of using technology to communicate, it should be used cautiously, considering the diverse audiences and contexts in which communication takes place. Hence, it is crucial to use discretion, civility, and professionalism when communicating through technology.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>Thats your 500 words essay</p><p></p><br />

                            20. make a reflection, of what you have learn about purposive communication (essay)​500 words​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Purposive communication is a type of communication that is intentional and goal-oriented. It involves the use of language and other forms of communication to achieve a specific objective or purpose. In my studies of purposive communication, I have learned about the importance of effective communication in achieving personal and professional goals.</p><p></p><p>One of the key things I have learned about purposive communication is that it requires careful planning and preparation. Before engaging in purposive communication, it is important to identify the objectives and goals that you want to achieve. This involves understanding the audience that you are communicating with, their needs, and their expectations. By doing so, you can tailor your message to meet their specific needs and ensure that your communication is effective.</p><p></p><p>Another important aspect of purposive communication is the use of clear and concise language. Effective communication requires that you use language that is easy to understand and that conveys your message clearly. This means avoiding jargon or technical terms that may not be familiar to your audience. By using simple and straightforward language, you can ensure that your message is understood and that your communication is effective.</p><p></p><p>I have also learned that purposive communication requires active listening. This means paying attention to the needs and concerns of your audience and responding appropriately. Effective communication requires that you listen to feedback and adjust your message accordingly. By doing so, you can ensure that your communication is relevant and meets the needs of your audience.</p><p></p><p>In addition to these key principles, I have also learned about the importance of nonverbal communication in purposive communication. Nonverbal communication includes things like body language, facial expressions, and tone of voice. These nonverbal cues can convey important information about your message and can help to reinforce your message. By paying attention to your nonverbal communication, you can ensure that your message is received and understood by your audience.</p><p></p><p>Overall, my studies of purposive communication have taught me that effective communication is essential for achieving personal and professional goals. By carefully planning and preparing your message, using clear and concise language, actively listening to your audience, and paying attention to your nonverbal communication, you can ensure that your communication is effective and achieves its intended purpose. Whether you are communicating with colleagues, clients, or friends and family, these principles of purposive communication can help you to communicate more effectively and achieve your goals.</p><br />
