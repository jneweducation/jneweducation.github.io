Formalist criticism is concerned with the ways in which the subject reinforces or undermines the economic political, social, and psychological oppression of women. 21. The Marxist examines the form or structure of the subject to be criticized as a whole. 22.

The concern in moral criticism is not only to discover meaning but also to determine whether works of literature are both true and significant. 24. Historical criticism explores the historical, social, political and cultural contexts surrounding the creation and reception of a work of literature; it uses history as a means of understanding a literary work more clearly. 25. There is no right or wrong answer to a reading response critique.
