                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>1. A. f(x) = 2x+ + x² - 4x² + 7x - 2 is a polynomial function because it is a sum of multiple powers of x with non-negative integer exponents.</p><p></p><p>2. B. y = (x + 1)(x - 1)(x - 2) represents the given graph in factored form because it is the product of three linear factors, which will give a graph with three distinct x-intercepts.</p><p></p><p>3. D. rises on left, falls on right. The end behavior of a polynomial function is determined by the leading coefficient and the degree of the polynomial. If the leading coefficient is positive and the degree is odd, the end behavior is rises on left, falls on right.</p><p></p><p>4. B. 63. To evaluate f(3), substitute 3 for x in the function: f(3) = 3(3)3 - 4(3)2 + 5(3) + 3 = 27 - 36 + 15 + 3 = 9.</p><p></p><p>5. C. 80 ft2. To find the maximum area of a rectangle with a perimeter of 40 feet, divide the perimeter by 4 to find the length of one side. 40/4 = 10, so the length and width of the rectangle are both 10. The area of the rectangle is 10 x 10 = 100 ft²</p><p></p><p>6. A. 180 minus the degree measure of the minor arc. The degree measure of a minor arc is equal to the measure of the central angle that intercepts it.</p><p></p><p>7. C. greater than. The measure of the central angle is greater than the measure of the inscribed angle that intercepts the same arc.</p><p></p><p>8. D. Diameter. A diameter is a straight line from one side of a circle to the other side that passes through the center point.</p><p></p><p>9. C. 360°. The sum of the measures of the central angles of a circle with no common interior points is 360°.</p><p></p><p>10. C. Intercepted angle. An angle whose vertex is on the circle and whose sides contain chords of the circle is called an intercepted angle.</p><p></p><p>11. B. 110. In a semicircle, the measure of the central angle is 180°, so the measure of the intercepted arc is 180°. Since the measure of angle SAD = 70, the measure of angle SAY is 180° - 70° = 110°</p><p></p><p>12. A. 45. If m CBMQ = 60, then m OBRO = 180 - m CBMQ = 180 - 60 = 120.</p><p></p>Pa Brainliest po, Thanks<br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>1. Multiplying (4 √5) (610) = 2466 √5</p><p></p><p>2. Dividing √32 by √2 = 4</p><p></p><p>3. Subtracting 4 √72 from 298 = 298 - (4 x √72) = 298 - (4 x √72) = 298 - 4 x 8.6603 = 298 - 38.6603 = 259.3397</p><p></p><p>4. Simplifying √45 + √80 + √20 = √45 + √4 x √20 + √20 = √45 + 2 √20 + √20 = √45 + 2 √20 + √20 = 3 √20 + √45</p><p></p><p>5. Simplifying 6 √x + √√x - 3 √√√y - √√y = 6 √x + √x^(1/2) - 3 √y^(1/3) - y^(1/2)</p><p></p><p>6. The value of x of √√x = 11 is x = 121</p><p></p><p>7. Solving for x in 5 √x - 1 = 40, x = (40 + 1)^2 / 5^2 = 41^2 / 5^2 = 1681 / 25 = 67.24</p><p></p><p>8. Evaluating 3xy for x = -2 and y = -2, 3xy = 3 x (-2) x (-2) = 12</p><p></p><p>9. To solve the equation √9x^2 - 4 = √x + 6, both sides of the equation will be raised to the power of 2, so (√9x^2 - 4)^2 = (√x + 6)^2. Solving for x, we get 9x^2 - 4 = x + 6 and 9x^2 - x - 10 = 0.</p><p></p><p>10. The hypotenuse of a right triangle whose legs are 6 cm and 12 cm = √6^2 + 12^2 = √144 + 144 = √288 = 16.97 cm</p><p></p><p>11. The time t (in seconds) it takes a free-falling object to fall h feet is given by the formula t = √(2h/g), where g = 9.8 m/s^2. If a ball is dropped from a height of 100 m, then t = √(2 x 100 / 9.8) = 2.5 seconds.</p><p></p><p>12. The square root of the sum of two consecutive odd integers is equal to 6. Let's call the smaller integer "n", so n + 2 = 2n. The equation becomes √(n^2 + 2n) = 6, so n^2 + 2n = 36, and n^2 + 2n - 36 = 0. Solving for n using the quadratic formula, we get n = (-2 ± √(2^2 - 4 x 1 x -36)) / (2 x 1) = (-2 ± √(4 + 144)) / 2 = (-2 ± √148) / 2 = (-2 ± 12.2) / 2 = (10.2) / 2 = 5.1 or (-14.2) / 2 = -7.1. Since n is an integer, we reject the negative value and conclude that the smaller integer is 5, and the larger integer is 5 + 2 = 7.</p><p></p><p>13. The time it takes a free-falling object to fall 100m is approximately 4.43 seconds using the formula t = √(2h/g), where h is the height and g is the acceleration due to gravity (9.8 m/s^2).</p><p></p><p>14.
