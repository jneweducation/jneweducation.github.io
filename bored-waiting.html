The spaces between the bookshelves are large enough to allow students to pass easily and go from case to case. The room is large, well ventilated, and well lighted. We can easily read the titles of the books - The Little Prince, Noli Me Tangere, Cinderella, and etcetera. The library is a popular place for students.____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________     2. ______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________B. We went on a trip to Tagaytay last weekend. We decided to go there so we can get  a splendid view of Taal Lake and Taal Volcano. Tagaytay is quite far from Manila so I decided to entertain myself by observing vehicles heading towards the same direction. I saw a jeep transporting fruits, a minivan, a bus full of passengers , and a truck transporting pigs. Soon I got bored with it and decided to think of games we could do in the park. We could play hide and seek, tug of war, and luksong tinik. I can't wait to get to Tagaytay.__________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________      2.  ________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________​</a>

Tagaytay is quite far from Manila so I decided to entertain myself by observing vehicles heading towards the same direction. I saw a jeep transporting fruits, a minivan, a bus full of passengers , and a truck transporting pigs. Soon I got bored with it and decided to think of games we could do in the park. We could play hide and seek, tug of war, and luksong tinik.
