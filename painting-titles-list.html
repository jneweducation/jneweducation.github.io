                                            Text Selection 1 The Jeepney - A Product of Filipino Ingenuity by Carmen Guerrero Nakpil 82 no one could do Bailey bridge, as insolent than the jeepney, If one were looking for a symbol of postwar Philippines, c y, which is as abundant and as persistent as postwar mosquitoes, as noisy and dangerous as postwar politics, as useful as a b as a squatter, and as much a creature of improvisation as the postwar Filipino. de a shop on an army jeep. It holds, in addition to its driver, from six to ten passengers and the most esoteric decorating job on wheels. Its body juts out way made body the asphalt. It looks just as crowded when it is carrying four as when it is carrying behind the original chassis and when fully loaded its rear lists perilously close twelve people - as it often does when business is good. Foreigners who come to Manila for the first time stare in disbelief at the fleets of jeepneys which swarm like a plague of locusts all over the city. They swear they have never seen anything quite like them. Indeed, no one who has become used to thinking of the army jeep as a drab, olive-colored drudge would recognize it on the streets of Manila in its reincarnation as the flamboyant Filipino jeepney. The man, who named the jeep the general-purpose vehicle, could never have imagined the possibilities that have now been unfolded by the Filipino jeepney. Not even the creator of the army jeep would recognize it now. Its staid radiator front hides behind a magnificent nickel-plated gird, lifted perhaps from a Cadillac or a Ford, or devised by some ingenious tin-smith to look like a dragon's maw. Its hood, now painted in a rhapsody of unexpected colors, rumbles menacingly beneath a figure-flying fish; its mudguards have been redesigned and now leap forward audaciously beneath twin quavering antennae bearing pompoms of varicolored plastic. The original canvas top no longer flaps about in tent-like simplicity. It reposes on a curved structure, like a shallow dome of welded iron, as proud as the marquee of a stylish hotel, fringed and lined with plastic leatherette The jeep's square body has become a quaint carriage as open as a verandah and as gay as a movie house. A railing of fretted metal runs down each side ending in two handle-bars of a design which another age called "modernistic" and which hamper rather than aid the descent and ascent of passengers at the rear steps. rest of the jeepney is painted in a characteristic design rendered in unpredictable color combinations which can best be described as Oriental baroque; whorls, lines stylized wings and shells are fluted and convoluted in geometrical precision and The bemuse the eye like a Manila Bay sunset. A jeepney is hardly a jeepney without its painted signs. Beneath the windshield the lettering may read Divisoria-Mahal Ko-Pasig or Manila and Suburbs-Heart and Soul. At the side is inscribed the name of the operator and an i of the passenger capacity. On the steps are more letters: a flirtatious Kiss Me Not o They are allusive, inspirational or romantic, being taken from movie titles, D a severe Keep Distance.

Beneath the windshield, the lettering may read DIVISORIA-MAHAL KO-PASIG I or MANILA and SUBURBS-HEART and SOUL. At the side is inscribed the name of the operator and an imaginative estimate of the passenger capacity. On the steps are more letters: a flirtatious kiss me not or a severe KEEP DISTANCE. Jeepney signs are extremely responsive to fad and fashion, they are allusive³, inspirational or romantic, being taken from movie titles, the name of show girls and actresses or slogans. they undoubtedly add piquancy⁴ to the traffic problem.the jeepney's prompted interior has undergone an even more complete transformation. above the cracked and dusty windshields, there is usually a strip of mirror, ornamented in the VENETIAN STYLE, which enable it's driver- conductor to keep an eye on the passengers who have not paid their fares. a central place on its reserved for an ikon or print of " OUR LADY OF PERLETUAL HELP" or " ST. ANTHONY," with a bunch of dusty paper flowers or a off sampaguitas paying tribute to the operator's favorite devotion. anyone who has taken a ride in a jeepney will realize how necessary is to explore the intercession of the saints, the jeepney's ikon is a traditional as the chapel where bullfighters kneel before the courting death.

                                            Activity C. My Opinion Matters An assertion is a strong opinion that one has about a topic. For an assertion to be reasonable, it must be supported by accurate citations which refer to evidence from reliable sources such as encyclopedias, academic journals, websites etc. From the author’s assertions about the jeepney, what details does she provide to convince the reader that the information is factual? What evidence is there to convince the reader that this is an opinion. Choose three statements from the passage, Jeepney- A Product of Filipino Ingenuity, and complete the Assertion Sheet below.Jeepney – A Product of Filipino Ingenuity (Excerpt)Carmen Guerrero-NakpilIf one were looking for a symbol of post-war Philippines, one could do no better than the jeepney, which is as abundant and as persistent as post-war mosquitoes, and as much a creature of improvisation1 as the post-war Filipino. The jeepney, unique in the world, is a tiny bus built by superimposing a shop-made body on an army jeep. It holds, in addition to its drivers, from six to ten passengers and the most esoteric2decorating job on wheels. Its body juts out way behind the original chassis and when fully loaded, its rear lists dangerously close to the asphalt. It looks just as crowded when it is carrying four as when it is carrying twelve people – as it often does when business is good. A jeepney is hardly without its painted signs. Beneath the windshield, the lettering may read Divisoria-Mahal Ko-Pasig or Manila and Suburbs-Heart and Soul. At the side is inscribed the name of the operator and an imaginative estimate of the passenger capacity. On the steps are more letters: a flirtatious Kiss Me Not or a severe Keep Distance. Jeepney signs are extremely responsive to fad and fashion. They are allusive3, inspirational or romantic, being taken from movie titles, the name of showgirls and actresses or slogans. They undoubtedly add piquancy4to the trafficproblem. The jeepney‘s cramped interior has undergone an even more complete transformation. Above the cracked and dusty windshield, there is usually a strip of mirror, ornamented in the Venetian style, which enables its driver-conductor to keep an eye on passengers who have not paid their fares. A central place on it is reserved for an icon or print of ―Our Lady of Perpetual Help‖ or ―St. Anthony,‖ with a bunch of dusty paper flowers or a garland of sampaguitas paying tribute to the operator‘s favorite devotion. Anyone who has taken a ride in a jeepney will realize how necessary it is to explore the intercession of the saints. The jeepney‘sikon is as traditional as the chapel where bullfighters kneel before courting death. Having made his box to the Divinity, the jeepney driver proceeds to be as bravo as a matador.1) Assertion (statement that starts argument)2) Reasoning (statement that supports assertion and explains why audience should believe it)3) Evidence (statement that back up reasoning)4) My Reaction (your own opinion on the author’s assertion)​</a>

Text Selection 1 The Jeepney - A Product of Filipino Ingenuity by Carmen Guerrero Nakpil 82 no one could do Bailey bridge, as insolent than the jeepney, If one were looking for a symbol of postwar Philippines, c y, which is as abundant and as persistent as postwar mosquitoes, as noisy and dangerous as postwar politics, as useful as a b as a squatter, and as much a creature of improvisation as the postwar Filipino. de a shop on an army jeep. It holds, in addition to its driver, from six to ten passengers and the most esoteric decorating job on wheels. Its body juts out way made body the asphalt. It looks just as crowded when it is carrying four as when it is carrying behind the original chassis and when fully loaded its rear lists perilously close twelve people - as it often does when business is good. Foreigners who come to Manila for the first time stare in disbelief at the fleets of jeepneys which swarm like a plague of locusts all over the city. They swear they have never seen anything quite like them. Indeed, no one who has become used to thinking of the army jeep as a drab, olive-colored drudge would recognize it on the streets of Manila in its reincarnation as the flamboyant Filipino jeepney. The man, who named the jeep the general-purpose vehicle, could never have imagined the possibilities that have now been unfolded by the Filipino jeepney. Not even the creator of the army jeep would recognize it now. Its staid radiator front hides behind a magnificent nickel-plated gird, lifted perhaps from a Cadillac or a Ford, or devised by some ingenious tin-smith to look like a dragon's maw. Its hood, now painted in a rhapsody of unexpected colors, rumbles menacingly beneath a figure-flying fish; its mudguards have been redesigned and now leap forward audaciously beneath twin quavering antennae bearing pompoms of varicolored plastic. The original canvas top no longer flaps about in tent-like simplicity. It reposes on a curved structure, like a shallow dome of welded iron, as proud as the marquee of a stylish hotel, fringed and lined with plastic leatherette The jeep's square body has become a quaint carriage as open as a verandah and as gay as a movie house. A railing of fretted metal runs down each side ending in two handle-bars of a design which another age called "modernistic" and which hamper rather than aid the descent and ascent of passengers at the rear steps. rest of the jeepney is painted in a characteristic design rendered in unpredictable color combinations which can best be described as Oriental baroque; whorls, lines stylized wings and shells are fluted and convoluted in geometrical precision and The bemuse the eye like a Manila Bay sunset. A jeepney is hardly a jeepney without its painted signs. Beneath the windshield the lettering may read Divisoria-Mahal Ko-Pasig or Manila and Suburbs-Heart and Soul. At the side is inscribed the name of the operator and an i of the passenger capacity. On the steps are more letters: a flirtatious Kiss Me Not o They are allusive, inspirational or romantic, being taken from movie titles, D a severe Keep Distance. Jeepney signs are extremely responsive to fad and fashion imaginative estimat the C C.1. Who is Carmen Guerrero Nakpil?2. How did the author describe jeepney?3. What does the jeepney symbolized?4. Is the creation of jeepney beneficial to Filipinos?5. Are you amenable to the proposed phase out of jeepney?​</h2><br />
                        1. Carmen Guerrero Nakpil is the author of the text "The Jeepney - A Product of Filipino Ingenuity."<br /><br />2. The author described the jeepney as a flamboyant, abundantly decorated vehicle that is noisy, crowded, and dangerous. It can carry six to ten passengers, and sometimes up to twelve, and is a creature of improvisation and ingenuity.<br /><br />3. The jeepney symbolizes postwar Philippines, with its abundance, persistence, usefulness, and improvisation. It is a product of Filipino ingenuity and resourcefulness, and a reflection of the country's history and culture.<br /><br />4. The text does not provide a direct answer to this question, but it does highlight the jeepney's usefulness, creativity, and cultural significance.<br /><br />5. As an AI language model, I do not have personal opinions or biases. However, the proposed phase-out of jeepneys is a controversial issue that has sparked debates and protests in the Philippines. Supporters argue that it is necessary to modernize the public transportation system and reduce air pollution, while critics argue that it will displace thousands of drivers and harm small businesses.<br />

                            15. Activity C. My Opinion Matters An assertion is a strong opinion that one has about a topic. For an assertion to be reasonable, it must be supported by accurate citations which refer to evidence from reliable sources such as encyclopedias, academic journals, websites etc. From the author’s assertions about the jeepney, what details does she provide to convince the reader that the information is factual? What evidence is there to convince the reader that this is an opinion. Choose three statements from the passage, Jeepney- A Product of Filipino Ingenuity, and complete the Assertion Sheet below.Jeepney – A Product of Filipino Ingenuity (Excerpt)Carmen Guerrero-NakpilIf one were looking for a symbol of post-war Philippines, one could do no better than the jeepney, which is as abundant and as persistent as post-war mosquitoes, and as much a creature of improvisation1 as the post-war Filipino. The jeepney, unique in the world, is a tiny bus built by superimposing a shop-made body on an army jeep. It holds, in addition to its drivers, from six to ten passengers and the most esoteric2decorating job on wheels. Its body juts out way behind the original chassis and when fully loaded, its rear lists dangerously close to the asphalt. It looks just as crowded when it is carrying four as when it is carrying twelve people – as it often does when business is good. A jeepney is hardly without its painted signs. Beneath the windshield, the lettering may read Divisoria-Mahal Ko-Pasig or Manila and Suburbs-Heart and Soul. At the side is inscribed the name of the operator and an imaginative estimate of the passenger capacity. On the steps are more letters: a flirtatious Kiss Me Not or a severe Keep Distance. Jeepney signs are extremely responsive to fad and fashion. They are allusive3, inspirational or romantic, being taken from movie titles, the name of showgirls and actresses or slogans. They undoubtedly add piquancy4to the trafficproblem. The jeepney‘s cramped interior has undergone an even more complete transformation. Above the cracked and dusty windshield, there is usually a strip of mirror, ornamented in the Venetian style, which enables its driver-conductor to keep an eye on passengers who have not paid their fares. A central place on it is reserved for an icon or print of ―Our Lady of Perpetual Help‖ or ―St. Anthony,‖ with a bunch of dusty paper flowers or a garland of sampaguitas paying tribute to the operator‘s favorite devotion. Anyone who has taken a ride in a jeepney will realize how necessary it is to explore the intercession of the saints. The jeepney‘sikon is as traditional as the chapel where bullfighters kneel before courting death. Having made his box to the Divinity, the jeepney driver proceeds to be as bravo as a matador.1) Assertion (statement that starts argument)2) Reasoning (statement that supports assertion and explains why audience should believe it)3) Evidence (statement that back up reasoning)4) My Reaction (your own opinion on the author’s assertion)​</h2><br />
