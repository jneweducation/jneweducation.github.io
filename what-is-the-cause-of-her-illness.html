                                            When I was ten years old, my best friend Linda's father died. We knew he had been
very sick, but Linda told us nothing else about his illness. When you are ten, the death
of someone close to you is usually too frightening to talk about. Linda's friends would
never have dreamed of asking, "What did your daddy die of?"
Although she moved to another city when we were both 13, I kept in touch with
Linda. When she was twenty, she told me that her brother Peter was ill. Peter was 31,
married, and had a two-year-old daughter. Over the next three years, I learned from
Linda that his condition had gotten much worse, and he had been confined to a
hospital. A year later Linda wrote to tell me that he had died and that her unmarried
sister Hope, then 33, was showing early signs of the same disease that had taken the
lives of her father and brother.
Linda disclosed in that letter that her father, Peter, and now Hope were victims of
Huntington's Disease. She explained that it is a genetic disease caused by an
autosomal dominant gene. Anyone who inherits the gene will suffer physical and
mental deterioration, usually beginning about age forty. Symptoms from the most
lethal form of the gene can sometimes begin several years earlier. The disease begins
by causing a variety of physical symptoms. The victim loses muscular control, soon
becoming unable to walk normally or do tasks requiring any coordinated motion.
Speech becomes difficult and then impossible. Within a few years, a serious mental
disturbance occurs followed inevitably by death. There is no cure, no effective
treatment for the disease.
One purpose of Linda's letter was to seek my advice. She faces a very difficult
decision. Genetic research has identified the form of the gene that causes Huntington's
disease. A test has been developed in which the gene is cloned, and DNA analysis can
be done to determine if a person is carrying the lethal allele. Linda is now 24 and she
has fallen in love. She knows there is a 50% chance that she inherited the lethal gene
from her father. The question she has asked me to help her with is should she have the
test done to find out whether or not she is doomed to suffer the same fate as her father,
brother, and sister?</a>

The next morning , bright and early, the queen dressed up and wore the gold necklace, then went to the king’s room.       “Good morning, my handsome handsome king,” greeted the queen joyously. As she bent over to kiss him, a ray of sunlight struck the necklace. Making it shine like a million stars in the heavens.      The king opened his eyes and seeing the gold necklace, smiled and embraced the queen.     “Now I know that you still loved me,” said the king.

                                            READING TEXT #1 Marie Curie was one of the most accomplished scientists in history. Together with her husband, Pierre, she discovered radium, an element widely used for treating cancer, and studied uranium and other radioactive substances. Pierre and Marie’s amicable collaboration later helped to unlock the secrets of the atom.Marie was born in 1867 in Warsaw, Poland, where her father was a professor of physics. At an early age, she displayed a brilliant mind and a blithe personality. Her great exuberance for learning prompted her to continue with her studies after high school. She became disgruntled, however, when she learned that the university in Warsaw was closed to women. Determined to receive a higher education, she defiantly left Poland and in 1891 entered the Sorbonne, a French university, where she earned her master’s degree and doctorate in physics.Marie was fortunate to have studied at the Sorbonne with some of the greatest scientists of her day, one of whom was Pierre Curie. Marie and Pierre were married in 1895 and spent many productive years working together in the physics laboratory. A short time after they discovered radium, Pierre was killed by a horse-drawn wagon in 1906. Marie was stunned by this horrible misfortune and endured heartbreaking anguish. Despondently she recalled their close relationship and the joy that they had shared in scientific research. The fact that she had two young daughters to raise by herself greatly increased her distress.Curie’s feeling of desolation finally began to fade when she was asked to succeed her husband as a physics professor at the Sorbonne. She was the first woman to be given a professorship at the world-famous university. In 1911 she received the Nobel Prize in chemistry for isolating radium. Although Marie Curie eventually suffered a fatal illness from her long exposure to radium, she never became disillusioned about her work. Regardless of the consequences, she had dedicated herself to science and to revealing the mysteries of the physical world.

                            8. When I was ten years old, my best friend Linda's father died. We knew he had been
very sick, but Linda told us nothing else about his illness. When you are ten, the death
of someone close to you is usually too frightening to talk about. Linda's friends would
never have dreamed of asking, "What did your daddy die of?"
Although she moved to another city when we were both 13, I kept in touch with
Linda. When she was twenty, she told me that her brother Peter was ill. Peter was 31,
married, and had a two-year-old daughter. Over the next three years, I learned from
Linda that his condition had gotten much worse, and he had been confined to a
hospital. A year later Linda wrote to tell me that he had died and that her unmarried
sister Hope, then 33, was showing early signs of the same disease that had taken the
lives of her father and brother.
Linda disclosed in that letter that her father, Peter, and now Hope were victims of
Huntington's Disease. She explained that it is a genetic disease caused by an
autosomal dominant gene. Anyone who inherits the gene will suffer physical and
mental deterioration, usually beginning about age forty. Symptoms from the most
lethal form of the gene can sometimes begin several years earlier. The disease begins
by causing a variety of physical symptoms. The victim loses muscular control, soon
becoming unable to walk normally or do tasks requiring any coordinated motion.
Speech becomes difficult and then impossible. Within a few years, a serious mental
disturbance occurs followed inevitably by death. There is no cure, no effective
treatment for the disease.
One purpose of Linda's letter was to seek my advice. She faces a very difficult
decision. Genetic research has identified the form of the gene that causes Huntington's
disease. A test has been developed in which the gene is cloned, and DNA analysis can
be done to determine if a person is carrying the lethal allele. Linda is now 24 and she
has fallen in love. She knows there is a 50% chance that she inherited the lethal gene
from her father. The question she has asked me to help her with is should she have the
test done to find out whether or not she is doomed to suffer the same fate as her father,
brother, and sister?</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>The question she has asked me to help her with is should she have the
</p><p>test done to find out whether or not she is doo_med to suffer the same fate as her father,  brother, and sister?</p><p></p><p>- I personally think that Linda should do the test. I know it can be frightening because she's dealing with life and de_ath but the thought about her possible situation would always bother her.   I believe that she must ready herself before taking the test and already reflected on how she would deal with the possible results. Truth is always connected with peace of mind.</p><p></p><p>#BRAINLYFAST!</p><p><strong></strong></p><p></p><br />

                            20. READING TEXT #1 Marie Curie was one of the most accomplished scientists in history. Together with her husband, Pierre, she discovered radium, an element widely used for treating cancer, and studied uranium and other radioactive substances. Pierre and Marie’s amicable collaboration later helped to unlock the secrets of the atom.Marie was born in 1867 in Warsaw, Poland, where her father was a professor of physics. At an early age, she displayed a brilliant mind and a blithe personality. Her great exuberance for learning prompted her to continue with her studies after high school. She became disgruntled, however, when she learned that the university in Warsaw was closed to women. Determined to receive a higher education, she defiantly left Poland and in 1891 entered the Sorbonne, a French university, where she earned her master’s degree and doctorate in physics.Marie was fortunate to have studied at the Sorbonne with some of the greatest scientists of her day, one of whom was Pierre Curie. Marie and Pierre were married in 1895 and spent many productive years working together in the physics laboratory. A short time after they discovered radium, Pierre was killed by a horse-drawn wagon in 1906. Marie was stunned by this horrible misfortune and endured heartbreaking anguish. Despondently she recalled their close relationship and the joy that they had shared in scientific research. The fact that she had two young daughters to raise by herself greatly increased her distress.Curie’s feeling of desolation finally began to fade when she was asked to succeed her husband as a physics professor at the Sorbonne. She was the first woman to be given a professorship at the world-famous university. In 1911 she received the Nobel Prize in chemistry for isolating radium. Although Marie Curie eventually suffered a fatal illness from her long exposure to radium, she never became disillusioned about her work. Regardless of the consequences, she had dedicated herself to science and to revealing the mysteries of the physical world.
