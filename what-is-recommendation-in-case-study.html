                                            The study was conducted in the secondary schools in Nigeria. To guide the investigation the researcher raised research question and formulated onehypothesis in the study. A sample of fifty-six schools was selected from a total population of 278 schools in the Delta North Senatorial District through the stratified random technique. In these fifty-six schools, there was a total of 5,315 staff from which respondents were drawn. Twenty per cent of the targetpopulation was the subject of the study.A questionnaire was used in collecting data which were analyzed using percentage and Z-test statistic. The result of the findings revealed that humanresources undergo different forms of training. The result also revealed that there is a significance difference between the performances of human resourcesin relation to students' academic performance. It was therefore concluded that school personnel should undergo training and attend regular workshops and seminars. Also that the performances of human resources have considerable effects on students' academic performance. The researcher thereforerecommended that the human resources in schools who are not trained professional staff should be advised to go for Post Graduate Diploma in Education to acquire teaching skills. They should be made to understand the importance of appropriate teaching methods for specific subject areas as they help thestaff perform more effectively1. What was investigated?a.

The store is not part of a chain of stores and has a very limited security budget. It has five machines for employees to use to check out movies and one server on which to keep centralized records. That server is in the manager’s office. The administrator takes the following security precautions: 1. Each machine is upgraded to Windows XP, with the personal firewall turned on. 2. Antivirus software was installed on all machines. 3. A tape backup is added to the server, and tapes are kept in a file cabinet in the manager’s office. 4. Internet access to employee machines is removed. Now consider these questions: 1. What did these actions accomplish? 2. What additional actions might you recommend?</a>

                                            3. According to Rappler,"
the Philippines' human rights situation is dire (extremely serious), with the number of extrajudicial killings, illegal arrests, and attacks against activists and critics unparalleled since the fall of the
Marcos dictatorship in 1986.
This is made worse by the Duterte government's inadequate and militarized response to the pandemic that has brought us to this: more than a million COVID-19 cases by May 2. Failed contact tracing, cong
protocols, delayed assistance to those who needed it most, incoherent policies, lack of transparency, and a slow vaccine rollout-all these have led to the abuse of basic human rights: the right to live, to we
to study, and to be protected by the state."
Given this state of human rights in the Philippines, what recommendations can you propose to address human rights issues? Give 3 and briefly explain each. </a>

                                            Case Study:
Lito Catapang, Operations Manager, and Baby Rambo, Maintenance Manager, both report to Dante Montecarlo, General Manager of Asbok Chemicals. Lito and Baby are about at the same age, well-educated and have extensive experience in their respective fields. It would be expected that these two individuals would compliment each other and be the answer to every general manager’s prayer. Unfortunately, that is not the case.
For some reasons, Lito and Baby find it necessary to challenge each other’s decisions and ideas anytime they have a mutual problem to solve, and they argue constantly in staff meetings. Recently Baby Rambo began to talk to peers in an effort to get them on her side. Lito learning of this, went to Dantee Montecarlo and demanded that he call Baby in and tell her to stop. Lito did not realize Dante Montecarlo was aware of what was happening. Nor did he now Dante had just learned that Lito had deliberately change a unit turn-around schedule so that it would fall during a period when the maintenance department already had a peak workload.
The matter has been further complicated by the fact that the employees of the two managers have taken side and join the fray. Productive work has come a standstill.
Questions:
What do you think is the main problem in this case?
What strategy would you best recommend to solve the problem?</a>

guide questions.
Mini Case Study
Mr. Kim, a supermarket manager, asks Sam to submit a report, which
includes a background analysis of some data and recommendations based
on the interpretation of that data. Mr. Kim asks Sam to get the report
together within two weeks. Off Sam goes. He delegates the research, the
analysis, and report writing to one of his subordinates, Sung, who
completes the work in ten days and gives the report to Sam. Sam takes
Sung's work, reads it, is satisfied with the content, retypes the page to
show his name, not Sung's, and then submits it to Mr. Kim as if it were his
work. He accepts praise and
dit to Sung, who in fact, did the
Text Box
research and wrote the repor
Guide Questions:
1. What is your reaction to Sam's act?
2. What do you think will be the reactions of Sung if he discovered it? How
about Mr. Kim's reactions?
3. How can you apply virtue ethics in this case?</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>1.objectively speaking, Sam's act of taking credit for Sung's work is unethical and dishonest.</p><p></p><p>2. If Sung discovers that Sam took credit for his work, he may feel disrespected, unappreciated, and betrayed. He may also lose trust in Sam and their working relationship may be affected. On the other hand, if Mr. Kim finds out, he may lose trust in Sam's abilities to manage and lead his team. He may also question Sam's integrity and honesty.</p><p></p><p>3. Virtue ethics emphasizes the importance of character and moral virtues in making ethical decisions. In this case, Sam's act of taking credit for Sung's work goes against virtues such as honesty, integrity, and fairness. Applying virtue ethics, Sam should have acknowledged Sung's contribution and given him credit for his work. He should have acted with honesty and fairness towards Sung and Mr. Kim.</p><p></p><br />

                            16. CASE STUDY:A 53-year old policeman man was rushed to the emergency room with complaints of chest pain. The attending physician noted that it might be a possible myocardial infarction. Laboratory tests and procedural assessment such as ECG monitoring is done and revealed sinus tachycardia.As the RT on duty, the physician asked you to administer nitroglycerin to decrease the chest pain felt by the patient. And you note that the patient's respiration is 20 breaths per minute and SpO2 is 92% of room air.Questions:1. What is your assessment of the patient’s oxygenation status?2. What is your recommendation in regards to administration of supplemental oxygen?​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p>1. Oxygenation may be assessed by clinical assessment, pulse oximetry and arterial blood gases. Pulse oximetry is commonly used to obtain a rapid and continuous assessment of oxygenation. Pulse oximetry measures oxygen saturation, which is the percentage of hemoglobin that is saturated with oxygen [2].<p></p><p></p>2. Normal levels of arterial blood oxygen are between 75 and 100 mmHg (millimeters of mercury). An oxygen level of 60 mmHg or lower indicates the need for supplemental oxygen. Too much oxygen can be dangerous as well, and can damage the cells in your lungs. Your oxygen level should not go above 110 mmHg.<p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p>#StudyFirst ➕#Brainlest ☀#Thank ❤ #Rate ⭐ #Follow ☺<br />

She strongly believed in slogan " When in Rome do as Roman's do", but in recent years she has been forced to rethink that position. In 2019, when the company considered opening a manufacturing branch in South Africa, it finally decided against the move, because of the existing apartheid laws which mandated racial segregation and discrimination against blacks. She is now faced  with 3 some what similar situations or were they similar? First, the company has the opportunity to contract at an excellent price for fabric woven in China. However, she has reports that the fabric probably came from factories employing forced labor. A second opportunity is to buy clothing manufactured in Pakistan. Again, however she has a reports from her sources that they are using child labor, usually girls under 14 year old. Her third opportunity is to open a plant in Saudi Arabia. In this situation she is warned that for the operation to be successful, women should not be placed in executive positions because they would not be taken seriously by those with they had to deal.Follow the basic case study format in answering the case study:a.

The store is not part of a chain of stores and has a very limited security budget. It has five machines for employees to use to check out movies and one server on which to keep centralized records. That server is in the manager’s office. The administrator takes the following security precautions: 1. Each machine is upgraded to Windows XP, with the personal firewall turned on. 2. Antivirus software was installed on all machines. 3. A tape backup is added to the server, and tapes are kept in a file cabinet in the manager’s office. 4. Internet access to employee machines is removed. Now consider these questions: 1. What did these actions accomplish? 2. What additional actions might you recommend?</h2><br />

                            25. 3. According to Rappler,"
the Philippines' human rights situation is dire (extremely serious), with the number of extrajudicial killings, illegal arrests, and attacks against activists and critics unparalleled since the fall of the
Marcos dictatorship in 1986.
This is made worse by the Duterte government's inadequate and militarized response to the pandemic that has brought us to this: more than a million COVID-19 cases by May 2. Failed contact tracing, cong
protocols, delayed assistance to those who needed it most, incoherent policies, lack of transparency, and a slow vaccine rollout-all these have led to the abuse of basic human rights: the right to live, to we
to study, and to be protected by the state."
Given this state of human rights in the Philippines, what recommendations can you propose to address human rights issues? Give 3 and briefly explain each. </h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>1. Investigate and prosecute human rights abuses: It is essential to hold accountable those who commit human rights abuses, whether they are government officials or individuals. This can be done through independent and impartial investigations and trials that follow due process. By holding perpetrators accountable, it sends a message that such abuses will not be tolerated and may discourage future abuses.</p><p></p><p>2. Strengthen the protection of human rights defenders and activists: Human rights defenders and activists play a crucial role in promoting and protecting human rights. However, they often face intimidation, harassment, and violence for their work. It is important to provide these individuals with the support and protection they need, such as through the establishment of a safe and secure environment in which they can work and speak out freely.</p><p></p><p>3. Promote transparency and accountability: Ensuring transparency and accountability can help prevent human rights abuses and ensure that those responsible for abuses are held accountable. This can be achieved through the implementation of effective oversight mechanisms, such as independent bodies that can investigate allegations of abuse and ensure that appropriate action is taken. It is also important to ensure that citizens have access to information about the actions of their government and can hold them accountable for their actions.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><br />

                            30. Case Study:
Lito Catapang, Operations Manager, and Baby Rambo, Maintenance Manager, both report to Dante Montecarlo, General Manager of Asbok Chemicals. Lito and Baby are about at the same age, well-educated and have extensive experience in their respective fields. It would be expected that these two individuals would compliment each other and be the answer to every general manager’s prayer. Unfortunately, that is not the case.
For some reasons, Lito and Baby find it necessary to challenge each other’s decisions and ideas anytime they have a mutual problem to solve, and they argue constantly in staff meetings. Recently Baby Rambo began to talk to peers in an effort to get them on her side. Lito learning of this, went to Dantee Montecarlo and demanded that he call Baby in and tell her to stop. Lito did not realize Dante Montecarlo was aware of what was happening. Nor did he now Dante had just learned that Lito had deliberately change a unit turn-around schedule so that it would fall during a period when the maintenance department already had a peak workload.
The matter has been further complicated by the fact that the employees of the two managers have taken side and join the fray. Productive work has come a standstill.
Questions:
What do you think is the main problem in this case?
What strategy would you best recommend to solve the problem?</h2><br />
