                            2. Imagine yourself to be the manager of a company. You are to promote one of your rank and file employees to being a senior staff. You are to choose between 2 employees who happens to have the same length of service with the company, same basic salary, committed no violation, no report of being late, and have the same average quarterly performance evaluation for the past 2 years. Their only difference lies in the standard deviations for their quarterly performance evaluation. Employee A has a standard deviation of 4.93 while Employee B has a standard deviation of 0.92 for their performance evaluation. Who do you think will the manager promote and why? </h2><br />
                        <p><strong>The standard deviation is the square root value of a variance, where this technique is used to assess the mean or expected. </strong>The standard deviation value is a value used in determining the distribution of data in a sample and seeing how close the data is to the mean value.</p><p></p><p>When to use the standard deviation formula?</p><p>The standard deviation formula is used by statisticians to determine whether the sample data used in calculations such as surveys can represent the entire population. With the standard deviation, one can give an idea of the quality of the sample data obtained.</p><p>In this case, the company uses the standard deviation to evaluate the performance. Where each employee has a standard deviation of performance per 4 months.</p><p></p><p>Which is better, a small or a large standard deviation?</p><p><strong>The larger the standard deviation value, the more diverse the values on the item or the more inaccurate the mean</strong>, conversely <strong>the smaller the standard deviation, the more similar the values on the item or the more accurate the mean</strong>. If the value of the standard deviation is smaller than the average value, then the performance can be said to be good.</p><p><strong>Answers :</strong></p><p>So it is known that Employee A has a standard deviation of 4.93 while Employee B has a standard deviation of 0.92 for their performance evaluation.</p><p><strong>So as a manager I will consider promoting employee B to senior staff.</strong></p><p>This is based on the consideration that they both have an average performance evaluation with the same value in the last 2 years. However, <strong>with the standard deviation test, employee B has a lower deviation value of 0.92, which means that the performance evaluation assessment is calculated to be more accurate than employee A, so that it becomes an indicator that is added value for employee B.</strong></p><p></p><p>Learn More About :</p><p>Standart form of 6x² -24 = 30 https://brainly.ph/question/7339519</p><p>#SPJ2</p><p></p><br />
