Come, saveme.The villagers heard the shout and ran to help him. But when they reach there, theycould see no lion and the boy was perfectly all right. The boy laughed at the villagers sayingno Lion: I did it only for fun."The villagers got highly annoyed and came back with an air of anger.Few days later the boy repeated the whole act. Again the villagers went to his rescuebut were duped again. Now they decided not to be fooled by him anymore.Unfortunately, one day, the Lion really came there.

Years later, I would occasionally recall this frequent occurrence and wonder what it was. Then one day all at once, like Sherlock Holmes solving a mystery, I understood: my nurse with me still on her back, was going to the toilet. What an insult! Many years later, my nurse came to see me. She looked up at this person who had reached nearly six feet and more than 150 pounds and just said, "My dear, how you've grown," as she clasped me around the knees and broke into tears. I had been ready to reproach her for the indignities she had caused me to suffer in the past, but suddenly I was moved by this figure of an old woman I no longer recognized, and all I could was stare vacantly down at her. hink It Over Thi Note the irony in the author's nonrecognition of the old woman who was his nurse and his memory of the nurse going to the totiet when he was still a baby.

The Wild Dog in Sheep's Clothing Once upon a time, in a valley by the sea a wild dog put on clothing that made him look like a sheep. Then he went to join a group of sheep. "I will fool the sheep," he said. And he did. The sheep did not know he was a dog. At night, he was put near the house with the sheep. "I will eat a sheep for my dinner," he said to himself. Just then the sheepherder came back to see the sheep. He wanted a sheep for dinner, too. Because the wild dog looked just like all the other sheep, the man had him for dinner.TITLE:TIME:PLACE:CHARACTER:BEGINNING:PA ANSWER NEED NA PO KASI​</a>

                                            Once upon a time, there were two blind women. They were kindhearted, but they were very poor. In order to eat, they had to beg from their neighbors and sometimes they were driven away or given nothing. Nevertheless, they did not complain but went on living each day as best as they could. Once when they had no food for some time, they decided to walk to the next village to try their luck there. They walked slowly, feeling for footholds among the hilly paths. When they had walked some distance, they bumped into a large rock. The impact sent their bodies reeling. Dazed, they held on to each other and tried to get back on their feet. But they had gone too long without food, and now they could not even stand. The rock opened magically, and out of its granite depths a young woman emerged. She took the two blind women by the hand and let them inside. An old woman seated them at a stone table and gave them food to eat. “Now tell me what you need,” said the old woman to them when they had finished their meal. One of the blind women said, “I am always hungry. I need food, but I am blind and I cannot work for a living in the fields.” The other replied, “I am always thirsty. I always need something to drink, but I, too, am blind and I cannot find my way even to the smallest spring.” The old woman gave the first woman a sack of rice that would never be empty. To the other she gave a bottle of water that would never be drained dry. They both thanked the old woman profusely and felt their way back home. They lived together happily, never wanting anything more than what they already had. After some time, though, they told each other that it was not right to keep to themselves the good fortune that they had been given. So the one who owned the magic sack of rice took a handful of grain and sowed it; when the grain was harvested, she gave it to the people in the village. The one who owned the magic bottle poured some of the water out onto the land where it changed into many small brooks and streams. On their banks flowers soon grew, and to the streams people came to fetch water for their various needs. Answer these questions orally. 1.When did the story happen?2. Who were the characters?3.

                                            The Origin of Rice and Small Streams
Once upon a time, there were two blind women. They were kindhearted, but
they were very poor. In order to eat, they had to beg from their neighbors and
sometimes they were driven away or given nothing. Nevertheless, they did not
complain but went on living each day as best as they could.
Once when they had no food for some time, they decided to walk to the next
village to try their luck there. They walked slowly, feeling for footholds among the hilly
paths. When they had walked some distance, they bumped into a large rock. The
impact sent their bodies reeling. Dazed, they held on to each other and tried to get
back on their feet. But they had gone too long without food, and now they could not
even stand.
The rock opened magically, and out of its granite depths a young woman
emerged. She took the two blind women by the hand and let them inside. An old
woman seated them at a stone table and gave them food to eat. "Now tell me what
you need," said the old woman to them when they had finished their meal.
One of the blind women said, "I am always hungry. I need food, but I am blind
and I cannot work for a living in the fields."
The other replied, "I am always thirsty. I always need something to drink, but I,
too, am blind and I cannot find my way even to the smallest spring."
The old woman gave the first woman a sack of rice that would never be empty.
To the other she gave a bottle of water that would never be drained dry. They both
thanked the old woman profusely and felt their way back home. They lived together
happily, never wanting anything more than what they already had.
After some time, though, they told each other that it was not right to keep to
themselves the good fortune that they had been given. So the one who owned the
magic sack of rice took a handful of grain and sowed it; when the grain was harvested,
she gave it to the people in the village. The one who owned the magic bottle poured
some of the water out onto the land where it changed into many small brooks and
streams. On their banks flowers soon grew, and to the streams people came to fetch
water for their various needs.</a>

The boy got bored and lonely on the hill all day with only the sheep for company. I know, he thought to himself. I will call out. Wolf!" and then the others will come running to help me and I will not be alone So, the boy called out, as loud as he could, Wolf Wolf". All the boys and men from his village came running. "Where is the woll?" they asked. "It ran off," the boy said. But one of the other boys stayed with him all the same, and he had company for the rest of the day. A few days later, the boy was feeling bored and lonely again. I would really like some company, he thought to himself. So once again he called out, Wolf Wolf!" and all the boys and men from his village came running. Again, he told them that the wolf had been frightened away by the sound of them coming. This time there was grumbling among the men, who didn't believe him. They were getting angry at having to drop their work and come running for no reason because of this foolish boy still as a precaution, they allowed one of the other boys to remain with him until it was time to bring the sheep back in the evening. A few days later, the boy was once again on the hill, tending his sheep, when he saw a real wolf skulking about the edges of his flock. The wolf was huge, and he had sharp, white teeth and bright, yellow eyes. The boy was very frightened. "Wolf Wolf" he cried out. Wolf!" But this time, no one came. The men in the village, who had become wise to the boy's trick, only laughed. There is no woll." they said to themselves. Meanwhile, the wolf ate all of the boy's sheep 21.

He got up to see what was making the noise. He saw his camel at the entrance to the tent. “Master!” said the camel. “It is very cold outside. May I put my head inside your tent? You have a warm fire in there.” The man answered, “You have a coat of fur to keep you warm. Oh well, put your head inside.” A little later, the camel said, “Master, the rest of me is cold. May I bring my front legs inside?” The man wanted to sleep, so he agreed. He moved over so there was room for the camel’s front legs. The camel was happy but not for long. “Master, my back legs are cold. Please move into the corner so that I can get them in.” The man moved and the camel came in. Now, there was no room in the tent at all. “Master, there isn’t any room in the tent. I cannot turn,” said the greedy camel. “There isn’t enough room for both of us. I am bigger that you are. I think you should go outside.” The man sat up and looked at his camel. “I knew this would happen. Why did I let you in?” he said as the camel pushed him into the cold.

Then answer the questions.There was once a wonderful musician, and he was one day walking through a wood all alone, he said to himself, "I will bring out a good companion."So he fiddled so that the wood echoed. A wolf came up to him. "Oh, a wolf!" Said the musician, "Ho, how finely you play! I must learn how to play too." "That is easily done," answered the musician, "you have only to do exactly as I tell you." "I will obey you," said the wolf. They came to an old oak tree, which was cleft through the middle. "Look here," said the musician, "if you want to learn how to fiddle, you must put your feet in this cleft." The wolf obeyed, but he took up a stone and wedged both his paws that the wolf was a prisoner. After a while he said to himself, I will bring out another companion," and fiddled away in the wood. This time a fox came "Oh, fox!" said the musician; the fox said, "O musician, how finely you play! I must learn how to play too." "That is easily done," said the musician, "you have only to do exactly as I tell you." "O musician," answered the fox, "I will obey you." So as they came to a footpath with a high hedge on each side and taking hold of a hazel-branch bent it down to the earth, and said: "Little fox, if you wish to learn something, reach your left foot."The fox obeyed. When the knots were fast enough he let go and the fox, shaking and struggling, in the air. The wolf meanwhile had struggled, and got himself out of the cleft. Full of anger he hastened after the musician to tear him to pieces. The fox cried out, "Brother Wolf, help me! The musician has betrayed me." The musician had again played his fiddle and a woodcutter with his axe under his arm, came to listen to the music. "It was a man I wanted, and not wild animals." And then he began to play so sweetly that the poor man's heart was filled with joy. And there came the wolf and the fox.

(10 points) The Boy Who Cried Wolf Once, there was a boy who became bored when he watched over the village sheep grazing on the hillside. To entertain himself, he sang out, "Wolf! Wolf! The wolf is chasing the sheep!" When the villagers heard the cry, they came running up the hill to drive the wolf away. But, when they arrived, they saw no wolf. The boy was amused when seeing their angry faces. "Don't scream wolf, boy," warned the villagers, "when there is no wolf!" They angrily went back down the hill. Later, the shepherd boy cried out once again, "Wolf Wolf! The wolf is chasing the sheep!" To his amusement, he looked on as the villagers came running up the hill to scare the wolf away. As they saw there was no wolf, they said strictly. "Save your frightened cry for when there really is a wolf! Don't cry 'wolf' when there is no wolf!" But the boy grinned at their words while they walked grumbling down the hill once more. Later, the boy saw a real wolf sneaking around his flock Alarmed, he jumped on his feet and cried out as loud as he could, "Wolf Wolf" But the villagers thought he was fooling them again, and so they didn't come to help. At sunset, the villagers went looking for the boy who hadn't returned with their sheep. When they went up the hill, they found him weeping "There really was a wolf here! The flock is gone! I cried out, 'Wolf' but you didn't come," he wailed.​</a>

Ash —
I’m worried to death because I haven’t been able to see you doing well.
You said we live in different worlds. But is that true?
We have different colored skin and eyes. We were born in different countries.
But we’re friends. Isn’t that what counts?
I’m really glad I came to America. I met lots of people.
And more than anything, I met you.
You asked me over and over if you scared me. But I never feared you, not once.
What’s more is you’re hurt much more than me. I couldn’t help feeling that way.
Funny, huh?
You’re way smarter, bigger, and stronger than me. But I always felt like I had to protect you. I wonder what it is I wanted to protect you from.
I wanted to protect you from fate.
The fate that tries to carry you away, drifting futher and futher.
You told me once about a leopard you read in a book. How you believed that leopard knew that it couldn’t go back.
And I said you weren’t a leopard, that you could change your destiny.
You’re not alone. I’m by your side.
My soul is always with you.

                                            DISCUSSIONBring in the ChickenOnce, long ago in Poland, there was a man who felt depressed. He went to his rabbi to tell him hisproblems."Rabbi," the man said, "I am so unhappy.""What is wrong?" said the rabbi"My house is so small. It only has one room. Not only do my wife and our five children live in it butalso my mother-in-law. What can I do?""Bring the chickens into the house," said the rabbi.The man went home. Everyone who knew the rabbi trusts that he was a very wise man. So the mandid as the rabbi said. A week later he came back to the rabbi."Rabbi," said the man, “it is worse with the chickens in the house. They squawk and flap around anddirty the floor. I am going to go crazy. What can I do?""Now," said the rabbi, "bring the pig into the house."The man did as the rabbi said, but it was only four days later this time when he went back to the"Rabbi," he said, “I thought it was bad with the chickens, but now with the pig it is even worse. I amalways tripping over it. And it tips over our table while we are eating. I cannot imagine that anyman could have a life that is worse than mine. What can I do?"Hmmm," said the rabbi. “Bring the cow into the house."The man went home and did as the rabbi told him, but he was back the very next day.“Rabbi," he said, “my house is like a barnyard. It is never quiet. There is no room to move now thatthe cow is in the house. I no longer worry about going crazy. I am crazy. Rabbi, I tell you, unless youcan help me. What can I do?"The rabbi smiled. "Ah," he said, "now take out the chickens."That story Dan Jacobsen told me made me laugh. It also made me realize that as many troubles as Ithought I had, thing could always be worse. But if I just solved one of those problems, things wouldbe better. To this day, whenever I feel overwhelmed, I only have to remember those words: “Nowrabbi.take out the chickens."ctivity 1. Answer the following questions:1. What was the problem of the man in the story that you read?2. Why did the man decide to ask the advice of the rabbi?3.What advice was given to the depressed and unhappy man?

You have a warm fire in there." The man answered, "You have a coat of fur to keep you warm. Oh well, put your head inside." A little later, the camel said, "Master the rest of me is cold. May I bring my front legs inside?" The man wanted to sleep, so he agreed. He moved over so there was room for the camel's front legs. The camel was happy but not for long * *Master my back legs are cold. Please move into the corner so that I can get them in." The man moved and the camel came in. Now, there was no room in the tent at all *Master, there isn't any room in the tent. I cannot turn" said the greedy camel. * There isn't enough room for both of us. I am bigger than you are. I think you should go outside." The man sat up and looked at his camel. "I knew this would happen. Why did I let you in?" he said as the camel pushed him into the cold.

                            6. Once upon a time, there were two blind women. They were kindhearted, but they were very poor. In order to eat, they had to beg from their neighbors and sometimes they were driven away or given nothing. Nevertheless, they did not complain but went on living each day as best as they could. Once when they had no food for some time, they decided to walk to the next village to try their luck there. They walked slowly, feeling for footholds among the hilly paths. When they had walked some distance, they bumped into a large rock. The impact sent their bodies reeling. Dazed, they held on to each other and tried to get back on their feet. But they had gone too long without food, and now they could not even stand. The rock opened magically, and out of its granite depths a young woman emerged. She took the two blind women by the hand and let them inside. An old woman seated them at a stone table and gave them food to eat. “Now tell me what you need,” said the old woman to them when they had finished their meal. One of the blind women said, “I am always hungry. I need food, but I am blind and I cannot work for a living in the fields.” The other replied, “I am always thirsty. I always need something to drink, but I, too, am blind and I cannot find my way even to the smallest spring.” The old woman gave the first woman a sack of rice that would never be empty. To the other she gave a bottle of water that would never be drained dry. They both thanked the old woman profusely and felt their way back home. They lived together happily, never wanting anything more than what they already had. After some time, though, they told each other that it was not right to keep to themselves the good fortune that they had been given. So the one who owned the magic sack of rice took a handful of grain and sowed it; when the grain was harvested, she gave it to the people in the village. The one who owned the magic bottle poured some of the water out onto the land where it changed into many small brooks and streams. On their banks flowers soon grew, and to the streams people came to fetch water for their various needs. Answer these questions orally. 1.When did the story happen?2. Who were the characters?3.

So once again he called out, Wolf Wolf!" and all the boys and men from his village came running. Again, he told them that the wolf had been frightened away by the sound of them coming. This time there was grumbling among the men, who didn't believe him. They were getting angry at having to drop their work and come running for no reason because of this foolish boy still as a precaution, they allowed one of the other boys to remain with him until it was time to bring the sheep back in the evening. A few days later, the boy was once again on the hill, tending his sheep, when he saw a real wolf skulking about the edges of his flock. The wolf was huge, and he had sharp, white teeth and bright, yellow eyes. The boy was very frightened. "Wolf Wolf" he cried out. Wolf!" But this time, no one came. The men in the village, who had become wise to the boy's trick, only laughed. There is no woll." they said to themselves. Meanwhile, the wolf ate all of the boy's sheep 21.

He got up to see what was making the noise. He saw his camel at the entrance to the tent. “Master!” said the camel. “It is very cold outside. May I put my head inside your tent? You have a warm fire in there.” The man answered, “You have a coat of fur to keep you warm. Oh well, put your head inside.” A little later, the camel said, “Master, the rest of me is cold. May I bring my front legs inside?” The man wanted to sleep, so he agreed. He moved over so there was room for the camel’s front legs. The camel was happy but not for long. “Master, my back legs are cold. Please move into the corner so that I can get them in.” The man moved and the camel came in. Now, there was no room in the tent at all. “Master, there isn’t any room in the tent. I cannot turn,” said the greedy camel. “There isn’t enough room for both of us. I am bigger that you are. I think you should go outside.” The man sat up and looked at his camel. “I knew this would happen. Why did I let you in?” he said as the camel pushed him into the cold.

Then answer the questions.There was once a wonderful musician, and he was one day walking through a wood all alone, he said to himself, "I will bring out a good companion."So he fiddled so that the wood echoed. A wolf came up to him. "Oh, a wolf!" Said the musician, "Ho, how finely you play! I must learn how to play too." "That is easily done," answered the musician, "you have only to do exactly as I tell you." "I will obey you," said the wolf. They came to an old oak tree, which was cleft through the middle. "Look here," said the musician, "if you want to learn how to fiddle, you must put your feet in this cleft." The wolf obeyed, but he took up a stone and wedged both his paws that the wolf was a prisoner. After a while he said to himself, I will bring out another companion," and fiddled away in the wood. This time a fox came "Oh, fox!" said the musician; the fox said, "O musician, how finely you play! I must learn how to play too." "That is easily done," said the musician, "you have only to do exactly as I tell you." "O musician," answered the fox, "I will obey you." So as they came to a footpath with a high hedge on each side and taking hold of a hazel-branch bent it down to the earth, and said: "Little fox, if you wish to learn something, reach your left foot."The fox obeyed. When the knots were fast enough he let go and the fox, shaking and struggling, in the air. The wolf meanwhile had struggled, and got himself out of the cleft. Full of anger he hastened after the musician to tear him to pieces. The fox cried out, "Brother Wolf, help me! The musician has betrayed me." The musician had again played his fiddle and a woodcutter with his axe under his arm, came to listen to the music. "It was a man I wanted, and not wild animals." And then he began to play so sweetly that the poor man's heart was filled with joy. And there came the wolf and the fox. Then the woodcutter raised his shining axe, and stood in front of the musician. Then the animals ran back into the wood, and the musician, played once more to the man to show his gratitude.Answer each question.1. What did the musician say to himself?2.

The wolf is chasing the sheep!" When the villagers heard the cry, they came running up the hill to drive the wolf away. But, when they arrived, they saw no wolf. The boy was amused when seeing their angry faces. "Don't scream wolf, boy," warned the villagers, "when there is no wolf!" They angrily went back down the hill. Later, the shepherd boy cried out once again, "Wolf Wolf! The wolf is chasing the sheep!" To his amusement, he looked on as the villagers came running up the hill to scare the wolf away. As they saw there was no wolf, they said strictly. "Save your frightened cry for when there really is a wolf! Don't cry 'wolf' when there is no wolf!" But the boy grinned at their words while they walked grumbling down the hill once more. Later, the boy saw a real wolf sneaking around his flock Alarmed, he jumped on his feet and cried out as loud as he could, "Wolf Wolf" But the villagers thought he was fooling them again, and so they didn't come to help. At sunset, the villagers went looking for the boy who hadn't returned with their sheep. When they went up the hill, they found him weeping "There really was a wolf here! The flock is gone!

Ash —
I’m worried to death because I haven’t been able to see you doing well.
You said we live in different worlds. But is that true?
We have different colored skin and eyes. We were born in different countries.
But we’re friends. Isn’t that what counts?
I’m really glad I came to America. I met lots of people.
And more than anything, I met you.
You asked me over and over if you scared me. But I never feared you, not once.
What’s more is you’re hurt much more than me. I couldn’t help feeling that way.
Funny, huh?
You’re way smarter, bigger, and stronger than me. But I always felt like I had to protect you. I wonder what it is I wanted to protect you from.
I wanted to protect you from fate.
The fate that tries to carry you away, drifting futher and futher.
You told me once about a leopard you read in a book. How you believed that leopard knew that it couldn’t go back.
And I said you weren’t a leopard, that you could change your destiny.
You’re not alone. I’m by your side.
My soul is always with you.

                            19. DISCUSSIONBring in the ChickenOnce, long ago in Poland, there was a man who felt depressed. He went to his rabbi to tell him hisproblems."Rabbi," the man said, "I am so unhappy.""What is wrong?" said the rabbi"My house is so small. It only has one room. Not only do my wife and our five children live in it butalso my mother-in-law. What can I do?""Bring the chickens into the house," said the rabbi.The man went home. Everyone who knew the rabbi trusts that he was a very wise man. So the mandid as the rabbi said. A week later he came back to the rabbi."Rabbi," said the man, “it is worse with the chickens in the house. They squawk and flap around anddirty the floor. I am going to go crazy. What can I do?""Now," said the rabbi, "bring the pig into the house."The man did as the rabbi said, but it was only four days later this time when he went back to the"Rabbi," he said, “I thought it was bad with the chickens, but now with the pig it is even worse. I amalways tripping over it. And it tips over our table while we are eating. I cannot imagine that anyman could have a life that is worse than mine. What can I do?"Hmmm," said the rabbi. “Bring the cow into the house."The man went home and did as the rabbi told him, but he was back the very next day.“Rabbi," he said, “my house is like a barnyard. It is never quiet. There is no room to move now thatthe cow is in the house. I no longer worry about going crazy. I am crazy. Rabbi, I tell you, unless youcan help me. What can I do?"The rabbi smiled. "Ah," he said, "now take out the chickens."That story Dan Jacobsen told me made me laugh. It also made me realize that as many troubles as Ithought I had, thing could always be worse. But if I just solved one of those problems, things wouldbe better. To this day, whenever I feel overwhelmed, I only have to remember those words: “Nowrabbi.take out the chickens."ctivity 1. Answer the following questions:1.
