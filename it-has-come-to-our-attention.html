Dear Fifth Graders,
We will no longer allow any
type of sports to be played during
recess. It has come to my attention
that fifth graders have been excluding
other kids from their games. In
addition, many fifth grade students
have been leaving sports equipment
in the yard, instead of putting it away
at the end of recess. You might think
that this is unfair. But, you will find
that there are other activities you can
participate in during recess, like
running laps. Sports are hereby
banned at our school.
Sincerely,
Your Principal

                                            OPENING OF THE PANAMA CANAL The Panama Canal was officially opened yesterday when a large vessel of the War Department, the Ancon, went through from ocean to ocean. The event was celebrated locally–it was a public holiday along the isthmus–and from New Orleans and other cities interested in the canal and expecting to use it and profit by it, congratulatory telegrams poured in. The big affair will not come for several months. It has been expected and arranged for that every maritime nation should send some of its crack men-of-war to take part in a great naval parade through the canal next year, and naval displays were proposed for New York, New Orleans and San Francisco. Invitations had been extended to all countries, and even Switzerland had been asked to have some vessel as its representative at Panama. What the celebration will be in the face of present European conditions it is impossible to say. It may be confined to our own fleet and that of our immediate neighbors. Even if the war is ended the chances are against such an international display as had been planned and as that attending the opening of the Suez Canal. Europe will be tired out, with no fever of festival and no desire for naval demonstrations. In the meanwhile, although the canal is now open, and vessels can operate through it, the government will continue to improve, to deepen it for larger vessels, and to make it wider, especially at the Culebra cut, which has been the most difficult portion of the canal from the very beginning. Because of the European trouble and the generally demoralized condition of the world’s merchant marine, the canal will not be used for commerce at the start to the extent that we had hoped for, and it will not be fair to take the first few months’ record as giving any idea what it will do. It is probable that a very large amount of the steamship tonnage going through the canal will be American coastwise vessels running between our Pacific and the Atlantic and Gulf coasts. It is gratifying to know that these vessels will include one or more lines from New Orleans, so that this city will get the share of the canal business it has expected. While there may be some slight disappointment over the fact that the canal was completed during a period of war, when it will not receive the attention it deserves, Americans will realize how much it means for us, how opportune it is. We can now send vessels to the Atlantic or Pacific as we wish, and be ready for any emergency in either ocean. Let us note that it is completed just in time, when, because of the European war, America has been given an opportunity to extend its merchant marine and its commerce. We will enter the trade of the Pacific under the most encouraging circumstances and conditions. All Americans will hail this great work of American genius, enterprise, courage and skill, the greatest engineering feat ever accomplished or even attempted by any land. In that rejoicing New Orleans, as the nearest American port to the canal, heartily and enthusiastically joins.Reading Comprehension Questions:1. The text says "naval displays were proposed for New York, New Orleans and San Francisco." Why do you think these cities were mentioned especially?2. The text refers to the plan for all countries to participate, "even Switzerland." Why do you think it singled out Switzerland?3. The article is from a New Orleans newspaper. Cite one quotation from the text that shows the article has a distinct point of view for New Orleans readers.4. What does demoralized mean here: "the generally demoralized condition of the world’s merchant marine"?​</a>

Then, answer the questions that followThe Value of WorkEverything has value no matter howsignificant or simple it is.At the mere mention of work, one immediately connects with it the idea of toil and fatigue which pertains to a slave who overdoes things in a difficult manner. Everything in this world involves work.In what light should work be viewed? Anything that comes from something done is achieved by means of labor and work. It is of two-fold nature, either mental or physical. Both are indispensable to the well-being of human society. Our attention is directed towards physical labor.Christianity teaches us to regard work as something sacred and honorable Work is duty. You must not only work highly, you must also love it heartly. Without it, order and cleanliness can never exist in the house. State of affairs would be a mess and discomfort prevailsPeople who work and are kept busy have no time for hanging around, gossiping, or being with bad company. Women who are fond of work are more virtuous and pure. There is no dull moment in their lives, there is so much to gain when they are physically preoccupied.Be proud, therefore, and love your work. Do it diligently and make your best. Treat it as an inseparable friend. Whatever the nature of your work may be, do it with care and industry. If it is a domestic chore, do not find fault and make critical remarks, but put your hand to everything.If your work is to be really done well, if it is to gain merit for yourself, perform it with good intention. Yes, be patient, for without patience, no labor, no toil or work can be meritorious in the eyes of Someone above.----------------------------------------------These lines speak well of this: Swiftly time speeds on its way See that thou use it well. Let each hour of everyday Be a tale of wisdom to tell.Summary of the text:​​​​</a>

From the presented figure, it is seen that majority of the parents do have the strongest faith and hope in education. For they all consider education to be the best game changer in life.

MANILA, Philippines - Health Secretary Francisco Duque III is urging the public to limit their family celebrations at home with immediate family members, attend online mass services instead, and defer plans to return to their home provinces this coming Christmas and New Year.

Those who refuse not to side with him will sure regret his/her ever biggest mistake of his/her life.5. Does our democracy is indeed a genuine one? Does it provide a fair and square opportunity to be heard? Does congress is really providing representation of the people from different places with different needs, interests, culture and faith? Do people beyond the poverty line are being provided the most needed attention not by the government alone but also by the entire stakeholders of the society? These questions are seeking the promptest answer from everyone. We should remember that we are all responsible to one another, as the saying states that no man is an island.6.

                                             pa tagalog plsss Japanese management once attracted global attention It was very difficult for Westerners to understand why employees work so hard for a company. Many observers concluded that Japan must have had some magical 1 t 3 management system. But they were wrong. The Japanese work force has been rooted in a tradition that values diligence. The reason some Japanese enterprises excel is that their employees share this set of values and work hard for the company. In the next decade the new generation, which grew up in more affluent times, will form the majority in the work force, and individualism will come to the forefront. The decline of Japanese companies could thus begin if excessive individualism leads their people to lose 2 appreciation for the value of work. In the United States today, companies like Hewlett-Packard and IBM, which advocates corporate ideals and philosophy, continue to prosper. No company should rely solely on employees' native diligence or traditional values to succeed. We must set forth a company philosophy for our young employees, share with them the real meaning of work, and give them a purpose in life.​</a>

Some people like small dogs that are easy to take care of and do not demand a lot of attention. Some owners prefer strong or vicious dogs, like bulldogs for example. Other people might like cats because they are independent and really need no attention at all. Birds provide people with a lot of company, if you like bird songs, but their cages need a lot of cleaning. A fish tank is great to look at but that tanks must be cleaned often as well. Some people even treat their plants like pets and talk to them. In a zoo, large animals, like polar bears, are left to themselves in their cages. 2. Every human like to wonder by nature. We wonder where our next meal is coming from or whether we have enough money to go out the next weekend. We wonder whether we might all catch a virus or disease if we are not careful, but what we can do? We also need to take care of our environment and car pollution is a major problem. Most large cars are gas guzzles and the gas is even getting more and more expensive. Who can afford a car anymore? Who needs a car anymore? We must control our natural resources. No wonder we are unhappy. 3.

                                            Can anyone translate this speech in tagalog please? 
"Ladies and gentlemen, today I would like to discuss a topic that has been debated for centuries – beauty or intelligence. Both are highly sought after qualities in our society, but which one holds more value? Some people believe that beauty is the key to success in life, while others argue that intelligence is far more important. As we delve deeper into this topic, we will examine the pros and cons of each and hopefully come to a better understanding of what truly makes a person successful.
Let's start by exploring the concept of beauty. Beauty is often considered to be a gift from nature, a physical attribute that can be enhanced through makeup and cosmetic procedures. People who possess this gift often enjoy a range of benefits, such as being more attractive to potential partners, having an easier time finding employment, and even earning higher salaries. However, it's important to remember that beauty is subjective, and what one person finds attractive, another may not. Moreover, beauty is fleeting – it fades with time, leaving one to rely on other qualities.
On the other hand, intelligence is a quality that lasts a lifetime. Intelligent people possess the ability to think critically, solve complex problems, and learn from their mistakes. These skills are highly valued in the workplace, where the ability to think outside the box and come up with innovative solutions can make all the difference. Intelligence is also highly beneficial in our personal lives, as it allows us to make informed decisions and communicate effectively with others.
While both beauty and intelligence have their advantages, it's clear that intelligence is the more valuable quality in the long run. Beauty may open doors, but it's intelligence that keeps them open. A beautiful person may initially attract attention, but it's their intelligence that will earn them respect and admiration. Additionally, intelligence can be developed through education and experience, whereas beauty is largely predetermined.
In conclusion, the debate between beauty and intelligence has raged on for centuries, with no clear winner. However, when we examine the advantages of each, it becomes clear that intelligence is the more valuable quality. Beauty may be alluring, but it's intelligence that truly sets a person apart from the crowd. So let us all strive to cultivate our minds and develop our intelligence, as it is the key to true success and fulfillment in life. Thank you."</a>

Dear Fifth Graders,
We will no longer allow any
type of sports to be played during
recess. It has come to my attention
that fifth graders have been excluding
other kids from their games. In
addition, many fifth grade students
have been leaving sports equipment
in the yard, instead of putting it away
at the end of recess. You might think
that this is unfair. But, you will find
that there are other activities you can
participate in during recess, like
running laps. Sports are hereby
banned at our school.
Sincerely,
Your Principal

                            4. OPENING OF THE PANAMA CANAL The Panama Canal was officially opened yesterday when a large vessel of the War Department, the Ancon, went through from ocean to ocean. The event was celebrated locally–it was a public holiday along the isthmus–and from New Orleans and other cities interested in the canal and expecting to use it and profit by it, congratulatory telegrams poured in. The big affair will not come for several months. It has been expected and arranged for that every maritime nation should send some of its crack men-of-war to take part in a great naval parade through the canal next year, and naval displays were proposed for New York, New Orleans and San Francisco. Invitations had been extended to all countries, and even Switzerland had been asked to have some vessel as its representative at Panama. What the celebration will be in the face of present European conditions it is impossible to say. It may be confined to our own fleet and that of our immediate neighbors. Even if the war is ended the chances are against such an international display as had been planned and as that attending the opening of the Suez Canal. Europe will be tired out, with no fever of festival and no desire for naval demonstrations. In the meanwhile, although the canal is now open, and vessels can operate through it, the government will continue to improve, to deepen it for larger vessels, and to make it wider, especially at the Culebra cut, which has been the most difficult portion of the canal from the very beginning. Because of the European trouble and the generally demoralized condition of the world’s merchant marine, the canal will not be used for commerce at the start to the extent that we had hoped for, and it will not be fair to take the first few months’ record as giving any idea what it will do. It is probable that a very large amount of the steamship tonnage going through the canal will be American coastwise vessels running between our Pacific and the Atlantic and Gulf coasts. It is gratifying to know that these vessels will include one or more lines from New Orleans, so that this city will get the share of the canal business it has expected. While there may be some slight disappointment over the fact that the canal was completed during a period of war, when it will not receive the attention it deserves, Americans will realize how much it means for us, how opportune it is. We can now send vessels to the Atlantic or Pacific as we wish, and be ready for any emergency in either ocean. Let us note that it is completed just in time, when, because of the European war, America has been given an opportunity to extend its merchant marine and its commerce. We will enter the trade of the Pacific under the most encouraging circumstances and conditions. All Americans will hail this great work of American genius, enterprise, courage and skill, the greatest engineering feat ever accomplished or even attempted by any land. In that rejoicing New Orleans, as the nearest American port to the canal, heartily and enthusiastically joins.Reading Comprehension Questions:1. The text says "naval displays were proposed for New York, New Orleans and San Francisco." Why do you think these cities were mentioned especially?2. The text refers to the plan for all countries to participate, "even Switzerland." Why do you think it singled out Switzerland?3. The article is from a New Orleans newspaper. Cite one quotation from the text that shows the article has a distinct point of view for New Orleans readers.4. What does demoralized mean here: "the generally demoralized condition of the world’s merchant marine"?​</h2><br />

Everything in this world involves work.In what light should work be viewed? Anything that comes from something done is achieved by means of labor and work. It is of two-fold nature, either mental or physical. Both are indispensable to the well-being of human society.

Do it diligently and make your best. Treat it as an inseparable friend. Whatever the nature of your work may be, do it with care and industry. If it is a domestic chore, do not find fault and make critical remarks, but put your hand to everything.If your work is to be really done well, if it is to gain merit for yourself, perform it with good intention.

According to statistics, there is a 60.78% of the Filipino parents want their children to finish their studies, while 30.23% of them are saying that they just want their children to get a decent and permanent job someday, and the remaining 3.99\% are believing that skills will lead their children to a better day. From the presented figure, it is seen that majority of the parents do have the strongest faith and hope in education. For they all consider education to be the best game changer in life. This should serve as an eye opener to all, especially to the youths, that education should be their priority, for this is the real avenue that will lead them to success.3. MANILA, Philippines - Health Secretary Francisco Duque III is urging the public to limit their family celebrations at home with immediate family members, attend online mass services instead, and defer plans to return to their home provinces this coming Christmas and New Year.

                            8.  pa tagalog plsss Japanese management once attracted global attention It was very difficult for Westerners to understand why employees work so hard for a company. Many observers concluded that Japan must have had some magical 1 t 3 management system. But they were wrong. The Japanese work force has been rooted in a tradition that values diligence. The reason some Japanese enterprises excel is that their employees share this set of values and work hard for the company. In the next decade the new generation, which grew up in more affluent times, will form the majority in the work force, and individualism will come to the forefront. The decline of Japanese companies could thus begin if excessive individualism leads their people to lose 2 appreciation for the value of work. In the United States today, companies like Hewlett-Packard and IBM, which advocates corporate ideals and philosophy, continue to prosper. No company should rely solely on employees' native diligence or traditional values to succeed. We must set forth a company philosophy for our young employees, share with them the real meaning of work, and give them a purpose in life.​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Ang pamamahala ng Hapon ay minsang nakaakit ng pandaigdigang atensyon Napakahirap para sa mga Kanluranin na maunawaan kung bakit ang mga empleyado ay nagtatrabaho nang husto para sa isang kumpanya. Napagpasyahan ng maraming tagamasid na ang Japan ay may ilang mahiwagang 1 t 3 na sistema ng pamamahala. Ngunit nagkamali sila. Nag-ugat ang Japanese work force sa isang tradisyon na pinahahalagahan ang kasipagan. Ang dahilan kung bakit napakahusay ng ilang negosyo sa Japan ay dahil ang kanilang mga empleyado ay nagbabahagi ng hanay ng mga halagang ito at nagsusumikap para sa kumpanya. Sa susunod na dekada, ang bagong henerasyon, na lumaki sa mas mayayamang panahon, ay bubuo ng karamihan sa lakas ng trabaho, at ang indibidwalismo ay mauuna. Ang pagbaba ng mga kumpanyang Hapones ay maaaring magsimula kung ang labis na indibidwalismo ay humantong sa kanilang mga tao na mawalan ng pagpapahalaga sa halaga ng trabaho. Sa Estados Unidos ngayon, ang mga kumpanyang tulad ng Hewlett-Packard at IBM, na nagtataguyod ng mga ideyal at pilosopiya ng korporasyon, ay patuloy na umuunlad. Walang kumpanyang dapat umasa lamang sa katutubong kasipagan o tradisyonal na pagpapahalaga ng mga empleyado upang magtagumpay. Dapat tayong magtakda ng pilosopiya ng kumpanya para sa ating mga kabataang empleyado, ibahagi sa kanila ang tunay na kahulugan ng trabaho, at bigyan sila ng layunin sa buhay.</p><br />

                            15. Directions: Read the following paragraphs and decide whether or not they are well-organized paragraphs of sufficient length and with a proper topic sentence. If yes, write acceptable, if not, write unacceptable. 1. There are many types of pets in an average household. People will often even choose pets according to their personalities. Some people like small dogs that are easy to take care of and do not demand a lot of attention. Some owners prefer strong or vicious dogs, like bulldogs for example. Other people might like cats because they are independent and really need no attention at all. Birds provide people with a lot of company, if you like bird songs, but their cages need a lot of cleaning. A fish tank is great to look at but that tanks must be cleaned often as well. Some people even treat their plants like pets and talk to them. In a zoo, large animals, like polar bears, are left to themselves in their cages. 2. Every human like to wonder by nature. We wonder where our next meal is coming from or whether we have enough money to go out the next weekend. We wonder whether we might all catch a virus or disease if we are not careful, but what we can do? We also need to take care of our environment and car pollution is a major problem. Most large cars are gas guzzles and the gas is even getting more and more expensive. Who can afford a car anymore? Who needs a car anymore? We must control our natural resources. No wonder we are unhappy. 3.

Life has not been a bed of roses for them. The adage ‘Uneasy lays the head that wears the crown’ has been rightly used for people, who are successful and are enjoying power and authority. ________ 2.

Women who are fond of work are more virtuous and pure. There is no dull moment in their lives, there is so much to gain when they are physically preoccupied.Be proud, therefore, and love your work. Do it diligently and make your best. Treat it as an inseparable friend. Whatever the nature of your work may be, do it with care and industry.

                            24. Can anyone translate this speech in tagalog please? 
"Ladies and gentlemen, today I would like to discuss a topic that has been debated for centuries – beauty or intelligence. Both are highly sought after qualities in our society, but which one holds more value? Some people believe that beauty is the key to success in life, while others argue that intelligence is far more important. As we delve deeper into this topic, we will examine the pros and cons of each and hopefully come to a better understanding of what truly makes a person successful.
Let's start by exploring the concept of beauty. Beauty is often considered to be a gift from nature, a physical attribute that can be enhanced through makeup and cosmetic procedures. People who possess this gift often enjoy a range of benefits, such as being more attractive to potential partners, having an easier time finding employment, and even earning higher salaries. However, it's important to remember that beauty is subjective, and what one person finds attractive, another may not. Moreover, beauty is fleeting – it fades with time, leaving one to rely on other qualities.
On the other hand, intelligence is a quality that lasts a lifetime. Intelligent people possess the ability to think critically, solve complex problems, and learn from their mistakes. These skills are highly valued in the workplace, where the ability to think outside the box and come up with innovative solutions can make all the difference. Intelligence is also highly beneficial in our personal lives, as it allows us to make informed decisions and communicate effectively with others.
While both beauty and intelligence have their advantages, it's clear that intelligence is the more valuable quality in the long run. Beauty may open doors, but it's intelligence that keeps them open. A beautiful person may initially attract attention, but it's their intelligence that will earn them respect and admiration. Additionally, intelligence can be developed through education and experience, whereas beauty is largely predetermined.
In conclusion, the debate between beauty and intelligence has raged on for centuries, with no clear winner. However, when we examine the advantages of each, it becomes clear that intelligence is the more valuable quality. Beauty may be alluring, but it's intelligence that truly sets a person apart from the crowd. So let us all strive to cultivate our minds and develop our intelligence, as it is the key to true success and fulfillment in life. Thank you."</h2><br />

Ang ilang mga tao ay naniniwala na ang kagandahan ay ang susi sa tagumpay sa buhay, habang ang iba ay nangangatuwiran na ang katalinuhan ay higit na mahalaga.

Gayunpaman, mahalagang tandaan na ang kagandahan ay subjective, at kung ano ang nakikita ng isang tao na kaakit-akit, ang iba ay maaaring hindi.

Ang mga kasanayang ito ay lubos na pinahahalagahan sa lugar ng trabaho, kung saan ang kakayahang mag-isip sa labas ng kahon at makabuo ng mga makabagong solusyon ay maaaring gumawa ng lahat ng pagkakaiba.
