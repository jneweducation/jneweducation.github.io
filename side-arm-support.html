                                            rocedure 1. Look at figure 1. The Compound Light Microscope. Locate the arm and the base. Hold the arm in your one hand and the base in your other hand. Suppose you carry it to the other side of your table and put it gently with its arm facing you. Place it about 17 centimeters away from the edge of the table. Q1. What are the functions of the base and the arm of the microscope? The base provides support, the arm is where the microscope is held The base supports the body tube, the arm is microscope's support 2. Look for the revolving nosepiece. Note that objectives are attached to it. You should know that there are lenses inside the objectives. Q2. What do you observe with the objectives of the microscope? They are of the same length They are marked with numbers followed by x 3. Find the coarse adjustment knob. Imagine that you are turning it slowly upwards and downwards. Q3. What do you think will happen if you slowly turn the coarse adjustment knob upwards and downwards? The body tube with the objectives raises and lowers The objectives change position 4. Locate the eyepiece. Note, that it is marked with a number and an x. The eyepiece further magnifies the image of the object that has been magnified by the objective. This is where you view objects. In an actual viewing, if the eyepiece is cloudy or dusty, wipe it gently with a piece of lens paper. 5. Now, locate the mirror. The mirror is used to reflect light from an external light source like diffused light from the windows or ceiling light. When you look through the eyepiece and with the concave mirror facing up, you have to move it until you see a bright circle of light known as the field of view of the microscope. Q4. What is the function of the miryor? Magnifies the image of the object Reflects light up to the diaphragm, objects to be observed and lenses 6. Locate the diaphragm. The diaphragm has different sized holes or openings and that it can be rotated to vary the intensity and size of the cone of light that is projected upward into the slide. As you rotate it, the amount of light reflected changes. The bigger the opening, the greater the amount of light reflected. Q5. What can you infer as to the function of the diaphragm? Regulates the amount of light reflected the object to be viewed Facilitates the changing of objectives​</a>

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Synovial joints allow the body a tremendous range of movements. Each movement at a synovial joint results from the contraction or relaxation of the muscles that are attached to the bones on either side of the articulation. The type of movement that can be produced at a synovial joint is determined by its structural type. While the ball-and-socket joint gives the greatest range of movement at an individual joint, in other regions of the body, several joints may work together to produce a particular movement. Overall, each type of synovial joint is necessary to provide the body with its great flexibility and mobility. There are many types of movement that can occur at synovial joints Movement types are generally paired, with one being the opposite of the other. Body movements are always described in relation to the anatomical position of the body: upright stance, with upper limbs to the side of body and palms facing forward.

                            13. rocedure 1. Look at figure 1. The Compound Light Microscope. Locate the arm and the base. Hold the arm in your one hand and the base in your other hand. Suppose you carry it to the other side of your table and put it gently with its arm facing you. Place it about 17 centimeters away from the edge of the table. Q1. What are the functions of the base and the arm of the microscope? The base provides support, the arm is where the microscope is held The base supports the body tube, the arm is microscope's support 2. Look for the revolving nosepiece. Note that objectives are attached to it. You should know that there are lenses inside the objectives. Q2. What do you observe with the objectives of the microscope? They are of the same length They are marked with numbers followed by x 3. Find the coarse adjustment knob. Imagine that you are turning it slowly upwards and downwards. Q3. What do you think will happen if you slowly turn the coarse adjustment knob upwards and downwards? The body tube with the objectives raises and lowers The objectives change position 4. Locate the eyepiece. Note, that it is marked with a number and an x. The eyepiece further magnifies the image of the object that has been magnified by the objective. This is where you view objects. In an actual viewing, if the eyepiece is cloudy or dusty, wipe it gently with a piece of lens paper. 5. Now, locate the mirror. The mirror is used to reflect light from an external light source like diffused light from the windows or ceiling light. When you look through the eyepiece and with the concave mirror facing up, you have to move it until you see a bright circle of light known as the field of view of the microscope. Q4. What is the function of the miryor? Magnifies the image of the object Reflects light up to the diaphragm, objects to be observed and lenses 6. Locate the diaphragm. The diaphragm has different sized holes or openings and that it can be rotated to vary the intensity and size of the cone of light that is projected upward into the slide. As you rotate it, the amount of light reflected changes. The bigger the opening, the greater the amount of light reflected. Q5. What can you infer as to the function of the diaphragm? Regulates the amount of light reflected the object to be viewed Facilitates the changing of objectives​</h2><br />
