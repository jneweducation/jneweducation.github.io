                            7. What do you think are the problems that you might encounter in planning an ICT project? ​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>There are several potential problems that one might encounter when planning an ICT (Information and Communications Technology) project. Here are some examples:</p><p></p><p>1. Unclear goals and requirements: If the goals and requirements of an ICT project are not clearly defined, it can lead to confusion and disagreements among team members. It's important to have a clear understanding of what the project is trying to achieve and what features and functionality are necessary to meet those goals.</p><p></p><p>2. Limited budget and resources: ICT projects can be expensive, and there may be limitations on the budget and resources available to complete the project. This can lead to the need to prioritize certain features or to find creative solutions to achieve the desired outcomes with limited resources.</p><p></p><p>3. Technical challenges: ICT projects often involve complex technical systems, and there may be technical challenges that arise during the planning phase. These challenges can range from issues with compatibility and integration to problems with scalability and security.</p><p></p><p>4. Stakeholder buy-in: ICT projects often involve multiple stakeholders with different priorities and perspectives. Getting buy-in from all stakeholders and keeping them engaged throughout the project can be a challenge, especially if there are conflicting priorities or a lack of understanding about the project's goals and benefits.</p><p></p><p>5. Time constraints: Like any project, ICT projects are often subject to time constraints. There may be deadlines that need to be met, and delays can have consequences for the project's success. It's important to carefully plan and manage the project timeline to ensure that the project stays on track.</p><p></p><p>Overall, planning an ICT project requires careful consideration of a wide range of factors. By anticipating potential problems and taking steps to mitigate them, project managers can increase their chances of success.</p><br />

Explain your answer.4. Do you think developing an advocacy through an ICT Project can help it's proponents in terms of their personal attributes such as self-confidence, self-actualization and perspective in life? Why?​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>1.)Social advocacy refers to the actions of brand advocates who publicly share information related to their experiences with a company or their perceptions of the business's brand identity. The term social advocacy can also be used to describe shared efforts to address widespread, systemic issues in society</p><p></p><p>2.)Advocacy … promotes equality, social justice and social inclusion. It can empower people to speak up for themselves. Advocacy can help people become more aware of their own rights, to exercise those rights and be involved in and influence decisions that are being made about their future</p><p></p><p>Advocacy seeks to ensure that all people in society are able to: Have their voice heard on issues that are important to them. Protect and promote their rights. Have their views and wishes genuinely considered when decisions are being made about their lives</p><p></p><p>3.)Media advocacy is the use of any form of media to help promote an organization's or a company's objectives or goals, which come from the group's vision and mission. For example, suppose you’re a media advocate for a non-profit agency working to reduce gang violence in your neighborhood. You would try to present neighborhood issues related to gang violence and the changes you want to make in such a way that you:</p><p></p><p>Change the way community members look at gang violence. You might want to make it clear who it affects and why, or why kids get involved in gangs in the first place.</p><p>Create a reliable, consistent stream of publicity for your agency's issues and activities, including articles and news items about the causes and results of gang violence and about what your agency’s work entails; personal interest stories; success stories; interviews with agency staff and current and former gang members, etc..</p><p>Motivate community members and policy makers to get involved.  You probably have ideas about what could be done with public funding, or with government policies that addressed gang violence. You might have volunteer opportunities, or want to publicize a city- or state-sponsored initiative that needs public input and support.  Or perhaps you’re trying to raise money for your work. The media can help with all of these...if you know how to work with them.</p><p>Media advocates, or the people who work to attract publicity for organizations and causes, know that the media can get a public or social policy message across to the largest audience possible in the least amount of time.</p><p></p><p>4.)Advocacy can help your organization achieve its political goals whatever they may be, including: improving public services such as transportation, information, etc. education. ... new laws that better protect the civil rights associations, including the legal recognition and other civil society organizations</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p><strong>DAILY </strong><strong>REMINDER</strong><strong> </strong><strong>:</strong><strong> </strong><strong>JESUS </strong><strong>LOVES</strong><strong> YOU</strong></p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>This paper is aiming at illustrating the potential of ICT for achieving the Sustainable Development Goals which were declared by the United Nations in 2015 as binding for all nations of our planet addressing both developing and developed countries. ICT must play a significant role if the SDGs should be achieved as projected in 2030. The paper gives an overview of some of the existing efforts in this area and is written as an appeal to all professionals, scientists and IT-professional and their organization to take a holistic approach for all ICT-activities and projects to always include and monitor the effects of their work on the SDGs. The impacts of ICT on sustainability are twofold: On the one hand there might be negative effects on sustainability such as the generation of electronic waste, on the other hand ICT is definitely an enabler to more efficient resource usage, education and business operations which is critical success factor for achieving the SDGs.</p><p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p><strong>How can ICT contribute to sustainable development?</strong>
</p><p>ICT makes improved monitoring and reporting possible for the conservation and sustainable use of land, as well as preventing biodiversity loss. This includes the use of big data to analyze short- and long-term trends and to plan mitigation strategies. Sensors, data collection and analysis also help in land restoration.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>According to some authors [8–15], ICT can influence economic growth through several significant channels, namely: the production of goods and services within the ICT sector directly contributes to the creation of value-added goods and services. Almost all firms and consumers use computers and Internet connection for economic purposes, such as providing consumers with a more diversified and customized products, improving product quality, and selling goods and services.12 Nov 2012e economy.</p><p><strong>thnx pa brainliest po</strong></p><br />

                        <p>Planning any kind of ICT project can be very difficult because there are so many variables involved. For example, if we were talking about building a new office complex or hospital then all kinds of things like cost estimates, construction schedules, etc., could play into how well our plan works out. However, when we talk about projects such as web sites, intranets, extranet portals, email systems, databases, etc., these types of projects tend to work better than others because they usually involve fewer variables. In addition, most companies already have some sort of system in place which makes them easier to implement. </p><br />

                            29. 2. If you are to create an ICT Project or Advocacy, what would it be and why?​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Information and Communications Technology (ICT) for Social Change and Women's Empowerment</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>Information and Communications Technology (ICT) offers us the possibility to acquire information and to connect with other people at a speed and across distances unprecedented in history. For those without access to ICT, the knowledge and resources gap can grow exponentially. This gap, often referred to as a “digital divide,” is usually caused by poverty and lack of infrastructure. In the case of women, cultural expectations and prejudice can further exacerbate their lack of access to ICT.</p><p></p><p>WLP believes that when women and girls across the world are able to harness ICT’s potential, they improve not only their own lives but can also advance their communities through their increased levels of employment, participation in governance, and application of better information about health, safety, finance, education, childrearing, social progress, and their rights.</p><p></p><p>"ICT can enable disadvantaged individuals and communities to participate in the national and global policy decisions that can change their lives and empower them to take actions that can financially, socially, and politically benefit them."</p><p></p><p>WLP recognizes this opportunity, and uses ICT as a tool for social change and women’s empowerment. Our programs and publications increase women’s ICT skills and confidence so that they can organize, mobilize, and advocate for issues that matter to them.</p><br />
