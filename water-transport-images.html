                                            HOW THE WORLD BEGANA POPULAR BUKIDNON FOLKTALEA long, long time ago, when there was yet no world, there were three gods who lived in a small circular space of great brightness. Called a banting, and encircled by a rainbow, the space was just large enough for the two gods, Magbabaya and Dadanyahan, to sit across each other. The third god, the winged Makabughaw, sat precariously between the two, and had to flap his wings continuously to maintain his balance. Taking pity on Makabughaw, the one-headed Magbabaya (meaning your will be done) decided to build an extension so the poor Makabughaw could rest. To do this, he had to scoop soil from under the ten-headed Dadanyahan. He asked Makabughaw to do this for him. After studying the situation, Makabughaw swooped into Dadanyahans mouths and dived right through him so he could get soil from that point. He has the soil to Magbabaya who created earth from it.  But the earth was dry. How could it have turned lush and green? As Magbabaya puzzled over the problem, he happened to glance at Dadanyahans ten drooling mouths. Suddenly, he realized where he could get enough water to sprinkle over the earth. Dadanyahan agreed to the plan. Magbabaya blessed Dadanyahans saliva and the rain poured. Water washed over the earth. It shaped the mountains, hills, valleys, and plains; it made the streams, rivers and huge seas and oceans. Soon, vegetation began to sprout and grow. But this huge garden needed someone to take care of it. The two gods scooped some earth, and with the help from Dadanyahans saliva, turned it into sticky clay to form a figure. They collected wood for its bones, rattan from its blood vessels, and water for its blood. They molded seven figures in Magbabayas image. After the seventh figure was molded, Magbabaya had to leave to take care of a few other things. But before leaving, he told Dadanyahan not to tamper with the figures. Left alone with the figures, Dadanyahan could not help touching them up the way he thought they should look. Magbabaya returned to find Dadanyahan using his creative talents on the figures. This triggered a fight between them which Makabughaw tried to arbitrate in vain. The two gods dueled with each other until their metal weapons sank to the ground. These became the minerals that the human race later forged into its own weapons and mode of transport. Finally, the warring God reached an agreement. Because Dadanyahan had made the final form of the figures, he kept six figures while Magbabaya had only one since it was he who thought up the idea. Dadanyahans six figures became the various engkanto or guardians of the soil, water, and marine life, the plants, forests, and creatures of thej forest. Magbabayas lone figure became the first human being. The bits of clay cut from the figures as they were being modeled became the lower forms of animals. And thus did the world begin.Questions1.

                            5. HOW THE WORLD BEGANA POPULAR BUKIDNON FOLKTALEA long, long time ago, when there was yet no world, there were three gods who lived in a small circular space of great brightness. Called a banting, and encircled by a rainbow, the space was just large enough for the two gods, Magbabaya and Dadanyahan, to sit across each other. The third god, the winged Makabughaw, sat precariously between the two, and had to flap his wings continuously to maintain his balance. Taking pity on Makabughaw, the one-headed Magbabaya (meaning your will be done) decided to build an extension so the poor Makabughaw could rest. To do this, he had to scoop soil from under the ten-headed Dadanyahan. He asked Makabughaw to do this for him. After studying the situation, Makabughaw swooped into Dadanyahans mouths and dived right through him so he could get soil from that point. He has the soil to Magbabaya who created earth from it.  But the earth was dry. How could it have turned lush and green? As Magbabaya puzzled over the problem, he happened to glance at Dadanyahans ten drooling mouths. Suddenly, he realized where he could get enough water to sprinkle over the earth. Dadanyahan agreed to the plan. Magbabaya blessed Dadanyahans saliva and the rain poured. Water washed over the earth. It shaped the mountains, hills, valleys, and plains; it made the streams, rivers and huge seas and oceans. Soon, vegetation began to sprout and grow. But this huge garden needed someone to take care of it. The two gods scooped some earth, and with the help from Dadanyahans saliva, turned it into sticky clay to form a figure. They collected wood for its bones, rattan from its blood vessels, and water for its blood. They molded seven figures in Magbabayas image. After the seventh figure was molded, Magbabaya had to leave to take care of a few other things. But before leaving, he told Dadanyahan not to tamper with the figures. Left alone with the figures, Dadanyahan could not help touching them up the way he thought they should look. Magbabaya returned to find Dadanyahan using his creative talents on the figures. This triggered a fight between them which Makabughaw tried to arbitrate in vain. The two gods dueled with each other until their metal weapons sank to the ground. These became the minerals that the human race later forged into its own weapons and mode of transport. Finally, the warring God reached an agreement. Because Dadanyahan had made the final form of the figures, he kept six figures while Magbabaya had only one since it was he who thought up the idea. Dadanyahans six figures became the various engkanto or guardians of the soil, water, and marine life, the plants, forests, and creatures of thej forest. Magbabayas lone figure became the first human being. The bits of clay cut from the figures as they were being modeled became the lower forms of animals. And thus did the world begin.Questions1. What was the beginning of the terrain of the earth, according to the legend? 2. What was the first human being made of? Why was it necessary to create humanbeings?3. Which character do you like best?
