                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong>
</p><p>6.) 66
</p><p>
<strong>Step-by-step explanation:</strong>
</p><p>
Basketball is a game played between 2 teams. The problem is asking how many total games will there be. This can be seen as taking 2 teams to play from 12 possible teams. We don't care about the order, but we care about one team playing another team.
</p><p>
</p><p>A combination is a selection of items from a collection such that the order of the selection does not matter. The formula for taking r things from n possible ones with no particular order is expressed by:
</p><p>
</p><p>
The "!" symbol is called "factorial". In simple terms,
</p><p>
</p><p>
For example, 4! is 4*3*2 = 24. Since it is a treated product, we can cancel out fractions with both x! on the numerator and denominator.
</p><p>
</p><p>There are 2 ways to solve this problem.
</p><p>
</p><p>This first way is via combination. We have n = 12, r = 2.
</p><p>
</p><p>Substituting n = 12, r = 2 to the combination formula gives us:
</p><p>
</p><p>
<strong>There are 66 possible games in the 12-team tournament.</strong>
</p><p>
</p><p>The <strong>second way </strong>is a bit intuitive. The first team, team 1, will play 11 of the teams, from team 2 to team 12. The second team, having played team 1 already, only plays 10 of the teams, from team 3 to team 12. This goes on until Team 11 plays 1 team, Team 12.
</p><p>
</p><p>We can add the following games.
</p><p>
We got the same answer from earlier, 66.</p><p></p><p>7.) 2 sets with 6 members</p><p></p><p>8.) a.) 2 committees</p><p>b.) 3 committees</p><p>c.) 1 committee</p><p>
