Observations before the reaction: a white powder was added to a clear liquid
Observations during the reaction: the reactants bubbled rapidly in the open beaker
Mass of reactants: 4.2 g
Mass of products: 4.0 g
The student concludes that mass was not conserved in the reaction.
Explain why this is not a valid conclusion. What might explain the difference in mass?</a>

Most of these reactions occur at special sites of reactivity known as functional groups, and these constitute one organizational scheme that helps us catalog and remember reactions.</p><p></p><p>Ultimately, the best way to achieve proficiency in organic chemistry is to understand how reactions take place, and to recognize the various factors that influence their course.</p><p></p><p>First, we identify four broad classes of reactions based solely on the structural change occurring in the reactant molecules.

The reverse is true of elimination reactions, i.e.the number of σ-bonds in the substrate decreases, and new π-bonds are often formed. Substitution reactions, as the name implies, are characterized by replacement of an atom or group (Y) by another atom or group (Z). Aside from these groups, the number of bonds does not change. A rearrangement reaction generates an isomer, and again the number of bonds normally does not change.</p><br />
