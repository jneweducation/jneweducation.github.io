Both patients experienced diarrhea and severe abdominal cramps, and prior to onset of digestive symptoms both had been treated by the same chiropractor. The chiropractor had administered colonic irrigations (enemas) to these patients. The device used for this treatment was a gravity-dependent apparatus using 12 liters of tap water. There were no check valves to prevent backflow, so all parts of the apparatus could have become contaminated with feces during each colonic treatment. The chiropractor provided colonic treatment to four or five patients per day. Between patients, the adaptor piece that is inserted into the rectum was placed in a "hot-water sterilizer." What two errors were made by the chiropractor?​</a>

                            17. CASE STUDY:A 53-year old policeman man was rushed to the emergency room with complaints of chest pain. The attending physician noted that it might be a possible myocardial infarction. Laboratory tests and procedural assessment such as ECG monitoring is done and revealed sinus tachycardia.As the RT on duty, the physician asked you to administer nitroglycerin to decrease the chest pain felt by the patient. And you note that the patient's respiration is 20 breaths per minute and SpO2 is 92% of room air.Questions:1. What is your assessment of the patient’s oxygenation status?2. What is your recommendation in regards to administration of supplemental oxygen?​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p>1. Oxygenation may be assessed by clinical assessment, pulse oximetry and arterial blood gases. Pulse oximetry is commonly used to obtain a rapid and continuous assessment of oxygenation. Pulse oximetry measures oxygen saturation, which is the percentage of hemoglobin that is saturated with oxygen [2].<p></p><p></p>2. Normal levels of arterial blood oxygen are between 75 and 100 mmHg (millimeters of mercury). An oxygen level of 60 mmHg or lower indicates the need for supplemental oxygen. Too much oxygen can be dangerous as well, and can damage the cells in your lungs. Your oxygen level should not go above 110 mmHg.<p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p>#StudyFirst ➕#Brainlest ☀#Thank ❤ #Rate ⭐ #Follow ☺<br />

Both patients experienced diarrhea and severe abdominal cramps, and prior to onset of digestive symptoms both had been treated by the same chiropractor. The chiropractor had administered colonic irrigations (enemas) to these patients. The device used for this treatment was a gravity-dependent apparatus using 12 liters of tap water. There were no check valves to prevent backflow, so all parts of the apparatus could have become contaminated with feces during each colonic treatment. The chiropractor provided colonic treatment to four or five patients per day. Between patients, the adaptor piece that is inserted into the rectum was placed in a "hot-water sterilizer."
