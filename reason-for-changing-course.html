                                            Television and childrenTelevision has become an integral part of a child's life. For the last thirty years, it has been transforming people'slives. It has an effect on almost every aspect of modern life. Although television may be used to educate children, programswith little or no educational value are commonly on broadcast.Experts are disturbed about the viewpoint that children are learning from television, typically, parents, classrooms,and churches have served as role models and educators for children.Since television has such a strong impact on children's attitudes and behavior, its presence in culture is growing inimportance - it is much more than a mere leisure practice. According to child psychologist Robert M. Liebert "the tool haschanged childhood more than any other psychological breakthrough in the history of the world."Another effect on media is extreme violence exposure. Children can become more violent as a result of watchingtelevision crime, according to many reports. Furthermore, when children are exposed to so much abuse on ty, they growused to it as the only alternative to tough circumstances. Children who are exposed to a lot of violence on TV may developapathy toward real aggression.A study conducted by Ronald S. Drabman has shown that compared to a control group, children who watched anaggressive television broadcast were slower to ask for adult help when a fight broke out among younger children.Children are probably influenced by clever ads directed at them. Dr. Dale Roeck claims that exposing children totoo much high-powered ads of sugar-rich products on tv puts their oral wellbeing at risk which, of course, has a detrimentalimpact on good diet."Almost half of the items that television sells to kids are products that people who care for kids believe shouldn't bepurchased in the first place," according to another expert Kids who are very young do not know the difference betweenadvertisements and programmes.1.What is the claim of the author?2.Write three effects of television to the children3.Does the reasoning of the author sound or valid?

What does the conclusion contain?                        Grading                 by Remzi Yavuz  As students we all have been challenged to do our best. Throughout our lives we have been labeled with our grades; in high school, the ones with low grades were left alone in misery, while the ones with higher grades were praised as the leaders of this horse race. Then, the question that comes into mind is: is it right to categorize students, does grading contribute to education? It is assumed and stated in the philosophy of the current educational system that grading encourages learning and without it students would not study. That is far from being true and also expresses another flaw of our education system. The system is based on fear the basic motive for students to study is fear of low grades. Furthermore, because the grades are the main criteria for passing courses, students do not study, they just develop methods of cheating. Thus, without learning the subject, they keep passing. Since grades received in exams are more important than learning the subject matter, all students have to do to pass their courses is memorizing how a specific problem is solved. Without knowing why such a method is used, students cannot apply their ability to solve the problem to daily life. However, they pass exams without learning why, how or what of the matter. Another disadvantage of grading is that grades of a student are not updated and will have a great impact in the long run. Apart from these problems, which can be virtually solved by optimizing and improving the grading system, the most important defect of the system cannot be repaired without changing the whole system. The grading system causes inequalities, superior-inferior relations, classifications, and even conflicts. It may be maintained that societies of the modern world are structured on these basic principles, but the fact that something exists does not justify it. Moreover, the people grown up in such an education system will not be able to see the other side of the walls, or will be afraid even to take a glimpse. To sum up, grading students is not a good practice and should be abolished. It is clear that education, especially education during childhood, has a great effect on one's life. And if you bring the children up in conditions of conflict and competition, they will look for conflicts in the future too.​</a>

                                            make your own news report in a video presentationMany urban communities are now besieged by illegal drugs. Fears of gang violence and muggings keep frightened residents at home. Even at home, citizens feel insecure, for drug-related break-ins and burglaries threaten. Open dealing on the street stirs the community's fears for its children. The police sometimes seem overwhelmed. Occasionally they are outgunned. More often, they are simply overmatched by the resilience of the drug commerce. Furthermore, their potential impact is neutralized by the incapacity of the courts and penal system to mete out deserved punishments. Urgent problems and limited resources demand managerial thought for their resolution. Thus, police executives facing the drug problem might usefully consider four strategic questions: What goals might reasonably be set for drug enforcement? What parts of the police department engage the drug problem and to what effect? What role can citizens and community groups usefully (and properly) play in coping with the problem? What basic strategies might the police department consider as alternative attacks on the problem? The goals of drug enforcement From a police chief's perspective, the drug problem presents distinguishable threats to community security. Most pressing is the violence associated with street-level drug dealing-This is one in a series of reports originally developed with some of the leading figures in American policing during their periodic meetings at Hanard University's John F. Kennedy School of Government. The reports are published so that Americans interested in the improvement and the future of policing can share in the information and perspectives that were part of extensive debates at the School's Executive Session on Policing. The police chiefs, mayors, scholars, and others invited to the meetings have focused on the use and promise of such strategies as community-based and problem-oriented policing. The testing and adoption of these strategies by some police agencies signal important changes in the way American policing now does business. What these changes mean for the welfare of citizens and the fulfillment of the police mission in the next decades has been at the heart of the Kennedy School meetings and this series of papers. We hope that through these publications police officials and other policymakers who affect the course of policing will debate and challenge their beliefs just as those of us in the Executive Session have done. The Executive Session on Policing has been developed and administered by the Kennedy School's Program in Criminal Justice Policy and Management and funded by the National Institute of Justice and private sources that include the Charles Stewart Mott and Guggenheim Foundations.

In addition, I find nothing uncomfortable about crawling into arumpled mass of sheets and blankets. On the contrary, I enjoy poking out acozy space for myself before drifting off to sleep.

They do not pin the reader to a dogma, which he must afterwards discover to be inexact; they do not teach him a lesson, which he must afterwards unlearn. They repeat, they rearrange, they clarify the lessons of life; they disengage us from ourselves, they constrain us to the acquaintance of others; and they show us the web of experience, not as we can see it for ourselves, but with a singular change–that monstrous, consuming ego of ours being, for the nonce, struck out. To be so, they must be reasonably true to the human comedy; and any work that is so serves the turn of instruction. But the course of our education is answered best by those poems and romances where we breathe a magnanimous atmosphere of thought and meet generous and pious characters.1.

                                            pa help plsCase Study: Solar Cell ManufacturerSolar Cell is a manufacturing company based in southern part of Korea that manufactures different types of solar-powered products. They have customers based in the local parts of the country and abroad. The company is growing fast due to the increased demand for non-conventional energy. The CEO of the company associates their success in the use of control charts for their manufacturing procedures which lets them control the quality of their final outputs.Although the company has been quite successful in the use of control charts for their manufacturing operations, it has extended the applications of control charts in their non-manufacturing sectors such as HR and Finance. The reason for this implementation is because of the majorincrease in employee attrition and significantly large budget allotted to several departments of the company. Based on the result of the exit interviews, most of the employees who left the company claimed that they experienced work-life imbalance particularly for the operators since they were required to work in extended hours in circumstances when their substitute partners would not be able to arrive to work on time or would not be able to report to work at all. The minority of the resigned employees thought that they were misaligned and not trained for their job, they felt undervalued and afraid that growth opportunities were not present in the company. Another problem area that the top management has observed involves the finance team of the company. The management have found out that allotted budgets in some departments or work units of the firm are unrealistic, inaccurate, and unreasonable. After reviewing all the problem areas of the organization, the company’s quality assurance team suggested the use of control charts in the two (2) departments where the problems are prevalent.However, another difficult situation arises due to the resistance of the employees toward the use of control charts which gains several complaints from the employees pertaining to exhausting additional workload since they would have to monitor and notate the different outflows and inflows in their major and minor day-to-day operations. There was a clear lack of understanding of the benefits of control charts and the need for change using control charts as a catalyst for change. The senior management team decided to provide a one-day awareness program for the HR and Finance people so that they can understand the expectations and the need for the control chart initiative within the company. Moreover, an executive awareness was also introduced to all senior management team so that they would understand the importance and benefits of control charts in the business.​Follow the suggested outline below in answering the case study:

                                            GRADING by Remzi Yavuz As students we all have been challenged to do our best. Throughout our lives we have been labeled with our grades; in high school, the ones with low grades were left alone in misery, while the ones with higher grades were praised as the leaders of this horse race. Then, the question that comes into mind is: is it right to categorize students, does grading contribute to education? It is assumed and stated in the philosophy of the current educational system that grading encourages learning and without it students would not study. That is far from being true and also expresses another flaw of our education system. The system is based on fear the basic motive for students to study is fear of low grades. Furthermore, because the grades are the main criteria for passing courses, students do not study, they just develop methods of cheating. Thus, without learning the subject, they keep passing. Since grades received in exams are more important than learning the subject matter, all students have to do to pass their courses is memorizing how a specific problem is solved. Without knowing why such a method is used, students cannot apply their ability to solve the problem to daily life. However, they pass exams without learning why, how or what of the matter. Another disadvantage of grading is that grades of a student are not updated and will have a great impact in the long run. Apart from these problems, which can be virtually solved by optimizing and improving the grading system, the most important defect of the system cannot be repaired without changing the whole system. The grading system causes inequalities, superior-inferior relations, classifications, and even conflicts. It may be maintained that societies of the modern world are structured on these basic principles, but the fact that something exists does not justify it. Moreover, the people grown up in such an education system will not be able to see the other side of the walls, or will be afraid even to take a glimpse. To sum up, grading students is not a good practice and should be abolished. It is clear that education, especially education during childhood, has a great effect on one's life. And if you bring the children up in conditions of conflict and competition, they will look for conflicts in the future too. 1. what is the author's reason for writing? 2. what words or phrases prove your answer 3. which paragraph is the introduction 4. which part is the body of the essay 5. what does each paragraph contain 6. which paragraph is the conclusion 7. which does the conclusion ​</a>

Although some people may think that she is a slob, she has some sound reasons for breaking the bedmaking habit. In the first place, she is not concerned about maintaining a tidy bedroom because no one except her ever ventures in there. If there is ever a fire inspection or a surprise date, she supposes she can dash in there to fluff up the pillow and slap on a spread. Otherwise, she is not bothered. In addition, she finds nothing uncomfortable about crawling into a rumpled mass of sheets and blankets. On the contrary, she enjoys poking out a cozy space for herself before drifting off to sleep. Also, she thinks that a tightly made bed is downright uncomfortable: entering one makes her feels like a loaf of bread being wrapped and sealed. Finally, and most importantly, she thinks bed-making is an awful way to waste time in the morning. She would rather spend those precious minutes checking emails or feeding the cat than tucking in corners or snapping the spread.Topic sentence:_________Supporting sentences:_________Concluding sentences:_________​</a>

                                            In England once there lived a big
And wonderfully clever pig.
To everybody it was plain
That Piggy had a massive brain.
He worked out sums inside his head,
There was no book he hadn't read.
He knew what made an airplane fly,
He knew how engines worked and why.
He knew all this, but in the end
One question drove him round the bend:
He simply couldn't puzzle out
What LIFE was really all about.
What was the reason for his birth?
Why was he placed upon this earth?
His giant brain went round and round.
Alas, no answer could be found.
Till suddenly one wondrous night.
All in a flash he saw the light.
He jumped up like a ballet dancer
And yelled, 'By gum, I've got the answer! '
'They want my bacon slice by slice
'To sell at a tremendous price!
'They want my tender juicy chops
'To put in all the butcher's shops!
'They want my pork to make a roast
'And that's the part'll cost the most!
'They want my sausages in strings!
'They even want my chitterlings!
'The butcher's shop! The carving knife!
'That is the reason for my life! '
Such thoughts as these are not designed
To give a pig great peace of mind.
Next morning, in comes Farmer Bland,
A pail of pigswill in his hand,
And piggy with a mighty roar,
Bashes the farmer to the floor…
Now comes the rather grisly bit
So let's not make too much of it,
Except that you must understand
That Piggy did eat Farmer Bland,
He ate him up from head to toe,
Chewing the pieces nice and slow.
It took an hour to reach the feet,
Because there was so much to eat,
And when he finished, Pig, of course,
Felt absolutely no remorse.
Slowly he scratched his brainy head
And with a little smile he said,
'I had a fairly powerful hunch
'That he might have me for his lunch.
'And so, because I feared the worst,
'I thought I'd better eat him first.'

Capitalize your answers whenever applicable. Ever since I moved into my own apartment last fall, I have gotten out of the habit of making my bed-except on Fridays, of course, when I change the sheets. Although some people may think that I am a slob, I have some sound reasons for breaking the bed-making habit (1) I am not concerned about maintaining a tidy bedroom because no one except me ever ventures in there. If there is ever a fire inspection or surprise date, I suppose, I can dash in there to fluff pillow and slap on a spread. . (2) I am not bothered. (3) I find nothing uncomfortable about crawling into a rumpled mass of sheets and blankets. (4) I enjoy poking out a cozy space for myself before drifting off to sleep. (5) I think that a tightly made bed is downright uncomfortable: entering one makes me feel like a loaf of bread being wrapped and sealed. (6) and (7) I think bed- making is an awful way to waste time in the morning. I would rather spend those precious minutes checking my email or feeding the cat than tucking in corners or snapping the spread. up the​</a>

                            6. Television and childrenTelevision has become an integral part of a child's life. For the last thirty years, it has been transforming people'slives. It has an effect on almost every aspect of modern life. Although television may be used to educate children, programswith little or no educational value are commonly on broadcast.Experts are disturbed about the viewpoint that children are learning from television, typically, parents, classrooms,and churches have served as role models and educators for children.Since television has such a strong impact on children's attitudes and behavior, its presence in culture is growing inimportance - it is much more than a mere leisure practice. According to child psychologist Robert M. Liebert "the tool haschanged childhood more than any other psychological breakthrough in the history of the world."Another effect on media is extreme violence exposure. Children can become more violent as a result of watchingtelevision crime, according to many reports. Furthermore, when children are exposed to so much abuse on ty, they growused to it as the only alternative to tough circumstances. Children who are exposed to a lot of violence on TV may developapathy toward real aggression.A study conducted by Ronald S. Drabman has shown that compared to a control group, children who watched anaggressive television broadcast were slower to ask for adult help when a fight broke out among younger children.Children are probably influenced by clever ads directed at them. Dr. Dale Roeck claims that exposing children totoo much high-powered ads of sugar-rich products on tv puts their oral wellbeing at risk which, of course, has a detrimentalimpact on good diet."Almost half of the items that television sells to kids are products that people who care for kids believe shouldn't bepurchased in the first place," according to another expert Kids who are very young do not know the difference betweenadvertisements and programmes.1.What is the claim of the author?2.Write three effects of television to the children3.Does the reasoning of the author sound or valid?

Throughout our lives we have been labeled with our grades; in high school, the ones with low grades were left alone in misery, while the ones with higher grades were praised as the leaders of this horse race. Then, the question that comes into mind is: is it right to categorize students, does grading contribute to education? It is assumed and stated in the philosophy of the current educational system that grading encourages learning and without it students would not study. That is far from being true and also expresses another flaw of our education system. The system is based on fear the basic motive for students to study is fear of low grades. Furthermore, because the grades are the main criteria for passing courses, students do not study, they just develop methods of cheating. Thus, without learning the subject, they keep passing. Since grades received in exams are more important than learning the subject matter, all students have to do to pass their courses is memorizing how a specific problem is solved. Without knowing why such a method is used, students cannot apply their ability to solve the problem to daily life. However, they pass exams without learning why, how or what of the matter. Another disadvantage of grading is that grades of a student are not updated and will have a great impact in the long run. Apart from these problems, which can be virtually solved by optimizing and improving the grading system, the most important defect of the system cannot be repaired without changing the whole system. The grading system causes inequalities, superior-inferior relations, classifications, and even conflicts. It may be maintained that societies of the modern world are structured on these basic principles, but the fact that something exists does not justify it. Moreover, the people grown up in such an education system will not be able to see the other side of the walls, or will be afraid even to take a glimpse. To sum up, grading students is not a good practice and should be abolished. It is clear that education, especially education during childhood, has a great effect on one's life. And if you bring the children up in conditions of conflict and competition, they will look for conflicts in the future too.​</h2><br />

                            9. make your own news report in a video presentationMany urban communities are now besieged by illegal drugs. Fears of gang violence and muggings keep frightened residents at home. Even at home, citizens feel insecure, for drug-related break-ins and burglaries threaten. Open dealing on the street stirs the community's fears for its children. The police sometimes seem overwhelmed. Occasionally they are outgunned. More often, they are simply overmatched by the resilience of the drug commerce. Furthermore, their potential impact is neutralized by the incapacity of the courts and penal system to mete out deserved punishments. Urgent problems and limited resources demand managerial thought for their resolution. Thus, police executives facing the drug problem might usefully consider four strategic questions: What goals might reasonably be set for drug enforcement? What parts of the police department engage the drug problem and to what effect? What role can citizens and community groups usefully (and properly) play in coping with the problem? What basic strategies might the police department consider as alternative attacks on the problem? The goals of drug enforcement From a police chief's perspective, the drug problem presents distinguishable threats to community security. Most pressing is the violence associated with street-level drug dealing-This is one in a series of reports originally developed with some of the leading figures in American policing during their periodic meetings at Hanard University's John F. Kennedy School of Government. The reports are published so that Americans interested in the improvement and the future of policing can share in the information and perspectives that were part of extensive debates at the School's Executive Session on Policing. The police chiefs, mayors, scholars, and others invited to the meetings have focused on the use and promise of such strategies as community-based and problem-oriented policing. The testing and adoption of these strategies by some police agencies signal important changes in the way American policing now does business. What these changes mean for the welfare of citizens and the fulfillment of the police mission in the next decades has been at the heart of the Kennedy School meetings and this series of papers. We hope that through these publications police officials and other policymakers who affect the course of policing will debate and challenge their beliefs just as those of us in the Executive Session have done. The Executive Session on Policing has been developed and administered by the Kennedy School's Program in Criminal Justice Policy and Management and funded by the National Institute of Justice and private sources that include the Charles Stewart Mott and Guggenheim Foundations.

                            14. The most influential books, and the truest in their influence, are works of fiction. They do not pin the reader to a dogma, which he must afterwards discover to be inexact; they do not teach him a lesson, which he must afterwards unlearn. They repeat, they rearrange, they clarify the lessons of life; they disengage us from ourselves, they constrain us to the acquaintance of others; and they show us the web of experience, not as we can see it for ourselves, but with a singular change–that monstrous, consuming ego of ours being, for the nonce, struck out. To be so, they must be reasonably true to the human comedy; and any work that is so serves the turn of instruction. But the course of our education is answered best by those poems and romances where we breathe a magnanimous atmosphere of thought and meet generous and pious characters.1.

                            17. pa help plsCase Study: Solar Cell ManufacturerSolar Cell is a manufacturing company based in southern part of Korea that manufactures different types of solar-powered products. They have customers based in the local parts of the country and abroad. The company is growing fast due to the increased demand for non-conventional energy. The CEO of the company associates their success in the use of control charts for their manufacturing procedures which lets them control the quality of their final outputs.Although the company has been quite successful in the use of control charts for their manufacturing operations, it has extended the applications of control charts in their non-manufacturing sectors such as HR and Finance. The reason for this implementation is because of the majorincrease in employee attrition and significantly large budget allotted to several departments of the company. Based on the result of the exit interviews, most of the employees who left the company claimed that they experienced work-life imbalance particularly for the operators since they were required to work in extended hours in circumstances when their substitute partners would not be able to arrive to work on time or would not be able to report to work at all. The minority of the resigned employees thought that they were misaligned and not trained for their job, they felt undervalued and afraid that growth opportunities were not present in the company. Another problem area that the top management has observed involves the finance team of the company. The management have found out that allotted budgets in some departments or work units of the firm are unrealistic, inaccurate, and unreasonable. After reviewing all the problem areas of the organization, the company’s quality assurance team suggested the use of control charts in the two (2) departments where the problems are prevalent.However, another difficult situation arises due to the resistance of the employees toward the use of control charts which gains several complaints from the employees pertaining to exhausting additional workload since they would have to monitor and notate the different outflows and inflows in their major and minor day-to-day operations. There was a clear lack of understanding of the benefits of control charts and the need for change using control charts as a catalyst for change. The senior management team decided to provide a one-day awareness program for the HR and Finance people so that they can understand the expectations and the need for the control chart initiative within the company. Moreover, an executive awareness was also introduced to all senior management team so that they would understand the importance and benefits of control charts in the business.​Follow the suggested outline below in answering the case study:

                            18. GRADING by Remzi Yavuz As students we all have been challenged to do our best. Throughout our lives we have been labeled with our grades; in high school, the ones with low grades were left alone in misery, while the ones with higher grades were praised as the leaders of this horse race. Then, the question that comes into mind is: is it right to categorize students, does grading contribute to education? It is assumed and stated in the philosophy of the current educational system that grading encourages learning and without it students would not study. That is far from being true and also expresses another flaw of our education system. The system is based on fear the basic motive for students to study is fear of low grades. Furthermore, because the grades are the main criteria for passing courses, students do not study, they just develop methods of cheating. Thus, without learning the subject, they keep passing. Since grades received in exams are more important than learning the subject matter, all students have to do to pass their courses is memorizing how a specific problem is solved. Without knowing why such a method is used, students cannot apply their ability to solve the problem to daily life. However, they pass exams without learning why, how or what of the matter. Another disadvantage of grading is that grades of a student are not updated and will have a great impact in the long run. Apart from these problems, which can be virtually solved by optimizing and improving the grading system, the most important defect of the system cannot be repaired without changing the whole system. The grading system causes inequalities, superior-inferior relations, classifications, and even conflicts. It may be maintained that societies of the modern world are structured on these basic principles, but the fact that something exists does not justify it. Moreover, the people grown up in such an education system will not be able to see the other side of the walls, or will be afraid even to take a glimpse. To sum up, grading students is not a good practice and should be abolished. It is clear that education, especially education during childhood, has a great effect on one's life. And if you bring the children up in conditions of conflict and competition, they will look for conflicts in the future too. 1. what is the author's reason for writing? 2. what words or phrases prove your answer 3. which paragraph is the introduction 4. which part is the body of the essay 5. what does each paragraph contain 6. which paragraph is the conclusion 7. which does the conclusion ​</h2><br />

                            22. In England once there lived a big
And wonderfully clever pig.
To everybody it was plain
That Piggy had a massive brain.
He worked out sums inside his head,
There was no book he hadn't read.
He knew what made an airplane fly,
He knew how engines worked and why.
He knew all this, but in the end
One question drove him round the bend:
He simply couldn't puzzle out
What LIFE was really all about.
What was the reason for his birth?
Why was he placed upon this earth?
His giant brain went round and round.
Alas, no answer could be found.
Till suddenly one wondrous night.
All in a flash he saw the light.
He jumped up like a ballet dancer
And yelled, 'By gum, I've got the answer! '
'They want my bacon slice by slice
'To sell at a tremendous price!
'They want my tender juicy chops
'To put in all the butcher's shops!
'They want my pork to make a roast
'And that's the part'll cost the most!
'They want my sausages in strings!
'They even want my chitterlings!
'The butcher's shop! The carving knife!
'That is the reason for my life! '
Such thoughts as these are not designed
To give a pig great peace of mind.
Next morning, in comes Farmer Bland,
A pail of pigswill in his hand,
And piggy with a mighty roar,
Bashes the farmer to the floor…
Now comes the rather grisly bit
So let's not make too much of it,
Except that you must understand
That Piggy did eat Farmer Bland,
He ate him up from head to toe,
Chewing the pieces nice and slow.
It took an hour to reach the feet,
Because there was so much to eat,
And when he finished, Pig, of course,
Felt absolutely no remorse.
Slowly he scratched his brainy head
And with a little smile he said,
'I had a fairly powerful hunch
'That he might have me for his lunch.
'And so, because I feared the worst,
'I thought I'd better eat him first.'

                            23. GRADING by Remzi Yavuz As students we all have been challenged to do our best. Throughout our lives we have been labeled with our grades; in high school, the ones with low grades were left alone in misery, while the ones with higher grades were praised as the leaders of this horse race. Then, the question that comes into mind is: is it right to categorize students, does grading contribute to education? It is assumed and stated in the philosophy of the current educational system that grading encourages learning and without it students would not study. That is far from being true and also expresses another flaw of our education system. The system is based on fear the basic motive for students to study is fear of low grades. Furthermore, because the grades are the main criteria for passing courses, students do not study, they just develop methods of cheating. Thus, without learning the subject, they keep passing. Since grades received in exams are more important than learning the subject matter, all students have to do to pass their courses is memorizing how a specific problem is solved. Without knowing why such a method is used, students cannot apply their ability to solve the problem to daily life. However, they pass exams without learning why, how or what of the matter. Another disadvantage of grading is that grades of a student are not updated and will have a great impact in the long run. Apart from these problems, which can be virtually solved by optimizing and improving the grading system, the most important defect of the system cannot be repaired without changing the whole system. The grading system causes inequalities, superior-inferior relations, classifications, and even conflicts. It may be maintained that societies of the modern world are structured on these basic principles, but the fact that something exists does not justify it. Moreover, the people grown up in such an education system will not be able to see the other side of the walls, or will be afraid even to take a glimpse. To sum up, grading students is not a good practice and should be abolished. It is clear that education, especially education during childhood, has a great effect on one's life. And if you bring the children up in conditions of conflict and competition, they will look for conflicts in the future too.Question: 1. what is the author's reason for writing? 2. what words or phrases prove your answer?3. which paragraph is the introduction?4. which part is the body of the essay?5. what does each paragraph contain? 6. which paragraph is the conclusion?7. which does the conclusion?​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p>The author's reason for writing is to argue against the practice of grading students and to suggest that it is a flawed system that does not contribute to education.Phrases that prove this answer include "is it right to categorize students," "grading encourages learning and without it students would not study," "the basic motive for students to study is fear of low grades," and "grading system causes inequalities, superior-inferior relations, classifications, and even conflicts."The introduction is not clearly marked, but the first paragraph can be considered the introduction as it introduces the topic of grading and its relationship to education.The body of the essay includes paragraphs 2-5, which provide arguments against the practice of grading students and the flaws of the grading system.Paragraph 1 introduces the topic, paragraph 2 argues that grading is based on fear and encourages cheating, paragraph 3 argues that grading focuses on memorization rather than true learning, paragraph 4 argues that grading creates inequalities and conflicts, and paragraph 5 suggests that the grading system cannot be fixed without a complete overhaul of the educational system.The conclusion is not clearly marked, but the last sentence of paragraph 5 can be considered the conclusion: "To sum up, grading students is not a good practice and should be abolished."The conclusion summarizes the author's main arguments and suggests that education should not be based on conflict and competition. It also provides a clear thesis statement that grading students is not a good practice and should be abolished.<p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p></p><p></p>Mark me Brainliest&lt;3<br />

If there is ever a fire inspection or surprise date, I suppose, I can dash in there to fluff pillow and slap on a spread. . (2) I am not bothered.
