                                            who to make it shorter
Another thing that affects cholesterol over absorption is lack of fiber in our diet. Fibers are types of carbohydrates that absorb lipids but cannot be absorbed by our intestines. Due to the inability of fibers to be absorbed, the fiber with the attached fats to eat directly go to be excreted by the large intestine. This means that the cholesterol that we intake while we eat can be lessened by adding fiber rich food in our diet. While fibers can be easily found in vegetables 
and fruits, we have a challenge of maintaining this kind of high fiber more veggies and fruits diet. This is dueto the high financial cost of this kind of diet. Citizens in classes A and B can easily sustain    eating this kind of diet long term but citizens in classes  C to E cannot afford to sustain this kind of diet thus they go back to a high fat and high carb diet. The high cost of vegetables and fruits has been one of the greatest agricultural dilemmas of our country today. We have all the mountains and fields to farm these kinds of goods but due to different factors that our agricultural sectors and farmers are facing, these inflate the prices of these products. Rampant smuggling of agricultural goods murders the marketing and pricing of our own goods. The low costing of smuggled goods leave our hard-earned native vegetables and fruits behind the shadow of these invasions thus, leaving our farmers to lower the prices of their persevered work into no more than their cost of production. Also land reforms that should have been a culprit of change for our farmers were left behind. Land reforms or agrarian reforms are changing legislation, laws, rules and regulations on the ownership of lands in our country. Sadly 70 percent of farmers in the Philippines are landless according to the National Federation of Sugar Workers (NFSW). The same organization reported 69 murdered agricultural workers by their own employees. Most of them rent farming lands summing-up to the increasing prices of fertilizers and irrigation services that causes the cost of production to increase. Giant farming oligopolies own large masses of land keeping the small-farmers in check. These small-farmers having the greatest efforts of their lives receive an injustible amount of three hundred pesos of their hard work due to their unfortunate state of not having their own land. NFSW also states that This will increase the trend of farmers discouraging their sons and daughters to run away from agriculture like it was a mud-pit of intolerable amount of hardships and pain. What will happen next? A Philippine with a negligible amount of farmers coping to catch breath like a fish taken out of water?  A land blessed with volcanic land rich in minerals built for agriculture and should be secured in food production to be thrown out of the window and be like an imbecile waiting for imported agricultural goods because our farmers are dead? A healthy agricultural system will provide a sustainable supply and low cost organic and healthy food that can be afforded by a simple Filipino people which will maintain their physical well being. And farmers with their own farmland can lower their production cost because they will not be paying rent. Lower the production cost, the lower will be the selling price.</a>

The latter practice is now running rampant that it has become an epidemic: more and more students nowadays use information technology to breach rules on academic honesty without them being aware of their violations. To put a stop to this, some suggestions are listed in the succeeding sentences. First, schools can create policies banning the use of phones during examinations. They can also create programs that will develop students' information literacy skills. To ensure that plagiarism is minimized at the very least, teachers can instruct their students to subject their work to online plagiarism trackers before submitting them. 8. Traffic, traffic, traffic: this is what we always face in Metro Manila. As a solution to this problem, one government agency suggested that jeepneys be banned in the Metro. I strongly oppose this suggestion for two reasons. To start, the Philippines has not yet built an adequate and low-cost public transportation method to manage the commuters. By banning this mode of transportation, we are posing a problem to those who cannot afford expensive transport systems like taxis. Aside from this, banning jeepneys affects our cultural identity. These colorful vehicles, as well as the actual experience of riding them, have become one of the symbols of the Philippines. It is therefore a cultural crime to bar them from the country's capital. 9. In the wild, there lived three young women who decided to build a shelter. However, they had different preferences, so each of them decided to build their own house. And so it was that opposite to a river, the youngest girl built a house using leaves and twigs. Adjacent to the youngest girl's house is the shelter of the eldest. She built a house using logs and she constructed it near the spring so she can easily access drinking water. In the middle of the forest, the middle child built her house. It stands between two hills and is quite far from her two sisters' houses, but she was contented. 10. There are many reasons why I prefer to live in the Metro. First and foremost, it has many exciting places. For example, you can go to Makati if you want to go shopping. If you want to experience the night life, you can visit the bars along Tomas Morato and Malate. In terms of job opportunities, the Metro houses most of the top companies that offer the best-paying jobs.​</a>

To protect your computer from being attacked by a virus, you need to install a reliable anti-virus software. To do this, first click the "Install Now" button. After you click this button, wait for the required files to be downloaded completely. Wait for the "Welcome to the Install Shield Wizard" window to open. Then, click the "Next" button. Read and accept the license agreement and click the "Next" button. Continue to click the "Next" button until you see the "Install" button. Once it appears, click the "Install" button and wait for a few minutes as the installation is completed. Once the technical support information appears, read it and then click the "Next" button. Click the "Finish" button. The installation is complete. 7. Technological innovations can be a great help to students, but they can also be used for hi-tech cheating. The latter practice is now running rampant that it has become an epidemic: more and more students nowadays use information technology to breach rules on academic honesty without them being aware of their violations. To put a stop to this, some suggestions are listed in the succeeding sentences. First, schools can create policies banning the use of phones during examinations. They can also create programs that will develop students' information literacy skills. To ensure that plagiarism is minimized at the very least, teachers can instruct their students to subject their work to online plagiarism trackers before submitting them. 8. Traffic, traffic, traffic: this is what we always face in Metro Manila. As a solution to this problem, one government agency suggested that jeepneys be banned in the Metro. I strongly oppose this suggestion for two reasons. To start, the Philippines has not yet built an adequate and low-cost public transportation method to manage the commuters. By banning this mode of transportation, we are posing a problem to those who cannot afford expensive transport systems like taxis. Aside from this, banning jeepneys affects our cultural identity. These colorful vehicles, as well as the actual experience of riding them, have become one of the symbols of the Philippines. It is therefore a cultural crime to bar them from the country's capital. 9. In the wild, there lived three young women who decided to build a shelter. However, they had different preferences, so each of them decided to build their own house. And so it was that opposite to a river, the youngest girl built a house using leaves and twigs. Adjacent to the youngest girl's house is the shelter of the eldest. She built a house using logs and she constructed it near the spring so she can easily access drinking water. In the middle of the forest, the middle child built her house. It stands between two hills and is quite far from her two sisters' houses, but she was contented.10. There are many reasons why I prefer to live in the Metro. First and foremost, it has many exciting places. For example, you can go to Makati if you want to go shopping. If you want to experience the night life, you can visit the bars along Tomas Morato and Malate. In terms of job opportunities, the Metro houses most of the top companies that offer the best-paying jobs.​</a>

                        <p>1. Good hygiene is needed in making product.</p><p>YES - Good hygiene is necessary in making any product, especially food items, to ensure that they are safe for consumption. Proper hygiene practices, such as hand washing, sanitizing equipment, and wearing appropriate protective gear, can help prevent the spread of germs and bacteria that can cause foodborne illnesses.</p><p></p><p>2. Follow your heart in starting a simple business.</p><p>NO - While passion and personal interest can be important factors in starting a business, it should not be the sole basis for decision making. It is important to conduct research, feasibility studies, and consider other practical factors, such as market demand, competition, and financial resources, to ensure that the business has a higher chance of success.</p><p></p><p>3. Applying “bahala na” system is good in producing simple product.</p><p>NO - The "bahala na" system, which loosely translates to "leave it to fate," is not a reliable approach in producing products, especially if it involves safety, quality, and consistency. It is important to follow standard procedures, guidelines, and best practices to ensure that the product meets the required standards.</p><p></p><p>4. Estimate your product price. Identify your market customers’ need.</p><p>YES - Estimating the product price and identifying the target market's needs are critical steps in developing a successful business.

                            10. who to make it shorter
Another thing that affects cholesterol over absorption is lack of fiber in our diet. Fibers are types of carbohydrates that absorb lipids but cannot be absorbed by our intestines. Due to the inability of fibers to be absorbed, the fiber with the attached fats to eat directly go to be excreted by the large intestine. This means that the cholesterol that we intake while we eat can be lessened by adding fiber rich food in our diet. While fibers can be easily found in vegetables 
and fruits, we have a challenge of maintaining this kind of high fiber more veggies and fruits diet. This is dueto the high financial cost of this kind of diet. Citizens in classes A and B can easily sustain    eating this kind of diet long term but citizens in classes  C to E cannot afford to sustain this kind of diet thus they go back to a high fat and high carb diet. The high cost of vegetables and fruits has been one of the greatest agricultural dilemmas of our country today. We have all the mountains and fields to farm these kinds of goods but due to different factors that our agricultural sectors and farmers are facing, these inflate the prices of these products. Rampant smuggling of agricultural goods murders the marketing and pricing of our own goods. The low costing of smuggled goods leave our hard-earned native vegetables and fruits behind the shadow of these invasions thus, leaving our farmers to lower the prices of their persevered work into no more than their cost of production. Also land reforms that should have been a culprit of change for our farmers were left behind. Land reforms or agrarian reforms are changing legislation, laws, rules and regulations on the ownership of lands in our country. Sadly 70 percent of farmers in the Philippines are landless according to the National Federation of Sugar Workers (NFSW). The same organization reported 69 murdered agricultural workers by their own employees. Most of them rent farming lands summing-up to the increasing prices of fertilizers and irrigation services that causes the cost of production to increase. Giant farming oligopolies own large masses of land keeping the small-farmers in check. These small-farmers having the greatest efforts of their lives receive an injustible amount of three hundred pesos of their hard work due to their unfortunate state of not having their own land. NFSW also states that This will increase the trend of farmers discouraging their sons and daughters to run away from agriculture like it was a mud-pit of intolerable amount of hardships and pain. What will happen next? A Philippine with a negligible amount of farmers coping to catch breath like a fish taken out of water?  A land blessed with volcanic land rich in minerals built for agriculture and should be secured in food production to be thrown out of the window and be like an imbecile waiting for imported agricultural goods because our farmers are dead? A healthy agricultural system will provide a sustainable supply and low cost organic and healthy food that can be afforded by a simple Filipino people which will maintain their physical well being. And farmers with their own farmland can lower their production cost because they will not be paying rent. Lower the production cost, the lower will be the selling price.</h2><br />

The latter practice is now running rampant that it has become an epidemic: more and more students nowadays use information technology to breach rules on academic honesty without them being aware of their violations. To put a stop to this, some suggestions are listed in the succeeding sentences. First, schools can create policies banning the use of phones during examinations. They can also create programs that will develop students' information literacy skills. To ensure that plagiarism is minimized at the very least, teachers can instruct their students to subject their work to online plagiarism trackers before submitting them. 8. Traffic, traffic, traffic: this is what we always face in Metro Manila. As a solution to this problem, one government agency suggested that jeepneys be banned in the Metro. I strongly oppose this suggestion for two reasons. To start, the Philippines has not yet built an adequate and low-cost public transportation method to manage the commuters. By banning this mode of transportation, we are posing a problem to those who cannot afford expensive transport systems like taxis. Aside from this, banning jeepneys affects our cultural identity. These colorful vehicles, as well as the actual experience of riding them, have become one of the symbols of the Philippines. It is therefore a cultural crime to bar them from the country's capital. 9. In the wild, there lived three young women who decided to build a shelter. However, they had different preferences, so each of them decided to build their own house. And so it was that opposite to a river, the youngest girl built a house using leaves and twigs. Adjacent to the youngest girl's house is the shelter of the eldest. She built a house using logs and she constructed it near the spring so she can easily access drinking water. In the middle of the forest, the middle child built her house. It stands between two hills and is quite far from her two sisters' houses, but she was contented. 10. There are many reasons why I prefer to live in the Metro. First and foremost, it has many exciting places. For example, you can go to Makati if you want to go shopping. If you want to experience the night life, you can visit the bars along Tomas Morato and Malate. In terms of job opportunities, the Metro houses most of the top companies that offer the best-paying jobs.​</h2><br />
