For exercise, she plays badminton three times a week. She likes to head for the courts around 6 pm. when most of the people are eating dinner. She warms up for 10minutes by practicing her forehand and backhand and then plays a hard, fast game with her regular partner for an hour. Afterward, she does some stretching exercises while her muscles are still warm and then cools down with an easy 5-minute walk. Then she showers and gets ready for dinner. Twice a week, she works out at the gym, with particular attention to keeping her arms strong and her shoulders limber. On Saturdays, she goes out dancing with friends.
