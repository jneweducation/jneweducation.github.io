                                            The term  1.____ is used in chemistry to describe a system in which one or more substances are homogeneously mixed or dissolved in another substance. A solution has two components, a solute and a solvent. The 2. ____ is the component that is dissolved, while the  3.____   is the dissolving agent. Usually, the solute is less abundant than the solvent.Another  4.____  is brass, which is composed of copper and zinc. In most liquid solutions, the solvent used is usually water. Water can dissolve more solutes than any other liquids; thus, it is called the  5.____ . An example of a  6.____   with a solid solute is a saline solution (sodium chloride dissolved in water). Gases can also dissolve in liquids such as in carbonated drinks (carbon dioxide dissolved in water). A gas can also mix with a  7.____ . Air is an example of a  8.____  made up of 79% nitrogen, a solvent to make 20% oxygen, and 1% trace gases.choices: gaseous solution, moisture in air, air natural gas, liquid solution, solvent, gaseous solution, universal solvent, solid solution, solute, solution.​</a>

                            12. The term  1.____ is used in chemistry to describe a system in which one or more substances are homogeneously mixed or dissolved in another substance. A solution has two components, a solute and a solvent. The 2. ____ is the component that is dissolved, while the  3.____   is the dissolving agent. Usually, the solute is less abundant than the solvent.Another  4.____  is brass, which is composed of copper and zinc. In most liquid solutions, the solvent used is usually water. Water can dissolve more solutes than any other liquids; thus, it is called the  5.____ . An example of a  6.____   with a solid solute is a saline solution (sodium chloride dissolved in water). Gases can also dissolve in liquids such as in carbonated drinks (carbon dioxide dissolved in water). A gas can also mix with a  7.____ . Air is an example of a  8.____  made up of 79% nitrogen, a solvent to make 20% oxygen, and 1% trace gases.choices: gaseous solution, moisture in air, air natural gas, liquid solution, solvent, gaseous solution, universal solvent, solid solution, solute, solution.​</h2><br />
