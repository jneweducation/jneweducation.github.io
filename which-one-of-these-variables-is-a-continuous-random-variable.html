Cluster sampling involves dividing a population into clusters or groups and then selecting one or more clusters randomly. This technique can be used to select a sample of schools in a district for a study.</p><p>e. Convenience sampling involves selecting individuals who are readily available or easily accessible. This technique can be used to select a sample of shoppers in a mall.</p><p>f. Purposive sampling involves selecting individuals based on specific criteria or characteristics. This technique can be used to select a sample of experts in a certain field.</p><p>Whether or not to use random sampling depends on the research question and the population being studied. If the population is large and diverse, random sampling can be useful to obtain a representative sample. A simple random sampling technique can be used to ensure that all individuals in the population have an equal chance of being selected.</p><p>It is more advantageous to compute the sample statistic because it is based on actual data collected from a sample of the population. The sample statistic can provide an estimate of the population parameter with a certain level of precision and confidence.</p><p>The advantage of choosing the population parameter is that it represents the true value of the characteristic being studied for the entire population. However, it can be difficult or impossible to obtain data for the entire population. The advantage of choosing the sample statistic is that it is based on actual data collected from a sample of the population, but it may not be a completely accurate representation of the population parameter.</p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>D</p><p><strong>Step-by-step explanation:</strong></p><p>First, let us define what a continuous random variable is.
</p><p>- A continuous random variable is a type of random variable wherein the <strong>data can take many values of infinite variation</strong>.  </p><p>
</p><p>To answer the question:
</p><p>a. The number of volunteers in a community - this can take many values because there is no limit as to how many people can volunteer
</p><p>
</p><p>b. The number of attendees in an Information Technology conference - this can also take many values because the attendees are not limited to a certain number only
</p><p>
</p><p>c. The tuition fee enrolled in different universities - due to factors like inflation rate and type of program enrolled, tuition fees fluctuate and vary every year or semester and can take many values
</p><p>
</p><p>d. The number of senators elected in the Philippines - there is a limit to how many senators can be elected as dictated in the constitution, which is 24.
</p><p>
</p><p>Therefore, the answer is D.
