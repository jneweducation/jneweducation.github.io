He rubbed the sleep from his eyes and slid off the bed, careful not to wake his little brother up. Walking quietly towards the kitchen, Jepoy could tell Lolo was still asleep, since he could still hear the snores from his room. It was still dark outside so he switched on the lights. They flickered for a moment, and Jepoy feared his Lolo had forgotten to pay the electric bill again, but they soon steadied so Jepoy breathed a sigh of relief. Quick as a flash, he fried some left-over rice and cooked pure foods corned beef. He clumsily laid out the table. Once he had finished, he swiftly donned his school uniform, grabbed his bag pack and shoes, and turned towards the door.“Kuya?” He heard a soft voice from behind him. “Puy!” He exclaimed “Why are you awake?” His little brother yawned and frowned. “Di ka mag bye bye?” Jepoy rolled his eyes but tousled his brother’s hair affectionately. “Bye! Ano, happy ka na?” His little brother gave him a toothy grin. Jepoy returned the smile and pinched his brother’s check before opening the door. “Take care of Lolo ha?” “Deal! Bring pasalubong later Kuya!” Jepoy shook his head and chuckled as he closed the door. He glanced at his watch and suddenly swore. He was going to be late for his first day of class!QUESTIONS:  1.

solicitation envelope from an unknown religious organization. Hanabi ignored the envelope
and closed her eyes, pretending to be asleep. Hinata, who sat beside Hanabi, took the time

                                            ANSWER PLSSS ASAP Text A I firmly believe that there is a colony of goblins living inside the moon, and the government is keeping this information from you. How do we know this ? Look at the moon! See that little squiggle? You were taught that was just a crater, but it isn't. It is actually actually the tip of an enermous goblin moon base. How do I know that? the goblins told me so. I have special phone line from my house to the moon- goblins, and through me, they can answer any question you've got. Our moon-door is always open, the goblins tell me. Text B Earth has just one moon - a rocky, cratered place, roughly a quarter the size of Earth and an average of 238,855 miles away. The Moon can be seen with the naked eye most nights as it traces its 27-day orbit around our planet. Chances are that when you imagine the night sky, one of the first things that comes to mind is the Moon "glowing" in the darkness. The Moon has always held a special place in our imaginations and in daily life. It's no wonder that we are fascinated. The Moon is Earth's only natural satellite and one that we can easily see most nights. What makes the Moon glow? The Moon does not shine with its own light. It simply reflects light coming shape each night from the Sun. Why does it look like the Moon is changing shape? From Earth, it might look like the Moon is our spot on Earth, we see - from a tiny sliver to a half moon to a full moon and back again. What's actually happening is that from different parts of the Moon lit up by the Sun as the Moon travels in its orbit. Is there actually a "dark side" of the Moon? No. The Moon rotates on its own axis at the same rate that it orbits around Earth. That means we always see the same side of the Moon from our position on Earth. The side we don't see gets just as much light, so a more accurate name for that part of the Moon is the "far side. "Even thousands of years ago, humans drew pictures to track the changes of the Moon. Later, people used their observations of the Moon to create calendars. Today, we study the Moon using telescopes and spacecraft. For example, NASA's Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter has been circling the Moon and sending back measurements since 2009. The Moon is the only other planetary body that humans have visited. On July 20, 1969, NASA astronauts Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin were the first people to set foot on the dusty surface of the Moon. Ten other American astronauts followed. They collected hundreds of pounds of lunar soil and rock samples, conducted experiments and installed equipment for follow-up measurements. Using a Venn Diagram compare the two text. Refer to the comprehensive questions below as your guide in writing the content of your diagram. 1. What are the difference between two passages? 2. What are the similarities of the two passages? 3. What is the authors point of view or claims on the first passage? How about for the second author? 4.What are the pieces of evidence that each author shown that their claim is accurate​</a>

Today, here at my grandparents’ home, the whole family was up early because it
was our grandfather’s birthday. We looked forward to spending our time here at the
farm. The landscape was refreshing to our eyes. When the sun shone in the morning or
before sunset, it made the rice fields much golden as the rice were ready for harvest.
Fruit trees abounded and full of ripe fruits making our mouths watery with anticipation.
The sound on the farm was relaxing and the breeze was soothing to our senses. After
waking Lolo up to greet him a happy birthday, we shared an early breakfast of puto,
sikwate, fresh mangoes, fried native chicken and grilled tilapia from the small fish pond
at the backyard. Then, we proceeded to do our tasks assigned for the day. Nene and
Pepe cleaned and decorated the sala. Downstairs were my cousins cleaning the lawn
and the backyard. Tatay, together with my uncle cooked the dishes we would share
later that day. Nanay and I prepared the desserts of suman, buko pie and fresh fruit
salad. Finally, at around 1:00 pm, everything was set. Lolo and Lola were summoned
to the dining room. We ate with delight and shared happy stories and Lolo was in high
spirits as more tuba was poured into his glass. It was indeed fun and memorable and I
looked forward to spending another day on the farm.

Saturday, April 23, 2020 Today, here at my grandparents' home, the whole family was up early because it was our grandfather's birthday. We looked forward to spending our time here at the farm. The landscape was refreshing to our eyes. When the sun shone in the morning or before sunset, it made the rice fields much golden as the rice were ready for harvest. Fruit trees abounded and full of ripe fruits making our mouths watery with anticipation. The sound on the farm was relaxing and the breeze was soothing to our senses. After waking Lolo up to greet him a happy birthday, we shared an early breakfast of puto, sikwate, fresh mangoes, fried native chicken and grilled tilapia from the small fish pond at the backyard. Then, we proceeded to do our tasks assigned for the day. Nene and Pepe cleaned and decorated the sala. Downstairs were my cousins cleaning the lawn and the backyard. Tatay, together with my uncle cooked the dishes we would share later that day. Nanay and I prepared the desserts of suman, buko pie and fresh fruit salad. Finally, at around 1:00 pm, everything was set. Lolo and Lola were summoned to the dining room. We ate with delight and shared happy stories and Lolo was in high spirits as more tuba was poured into his glass. It was indeed fun and memorable and I looked forward to spending another day on the farm. Questions: 1. What tense of the verb was used? Give examples of these verbs (at least 3). 2.

A few days later, the boy was feeling bored and lonely again. I would really like some company, he thought to himself. So once again he called out, Wolf Wolf!" and all the boys and men from his village came running. Again, he told them that the wolf had been frightened away by the sound of them coming. This time there was grumbling among the men, who didn't believe him. They were getting angry at having to drop their work and come running for no reason because of this foolish boy still as a precaution, they allowed one of the other boys to remain with him until it was time to bring the sheep back in the evening. A few days later, the boy was once again on the hill, tending his sheep, when he saw a real wolf skulking about the edges of his flock. The wolf was huge, and he had sharp, white teeth and bright, yellow eyes. The boy was very frightened. "Wolf Wolf" he cried out. Wolf!" But this time, no one came. The men in the village, who had become wise to the boy's trick, only laughed. There is no woll." they said to themselves. Meanwhile, the wolf ate all of the boy's sheep 21.

Walking quietly towards the kitchen, Jepoy could tell Lolo was still asleep, since he could still hear the snores from his room. It was still dark outside so he switched on the lights. They flickered for a moment, and Jepoy feared his Lolo had forgotten to pay the electric bill again, but they soon steadied so Jepoy breathed a sigh of relief. Quick as a flash, he fried some left-over rice and cooked pure foods corned beef. He clumsily laid out the table. Once he had finished, he swiftly donned his school uniform, grabbed his bag pack and shoes, and turned towards the door.“Kuya?” He heard a soft voice from behind him. “Puy!” He exclaimed “Why are you awake?” His little brother yawned and frowned. “Di ka mag bye bye?” Jepoy rolled his eyes but tousled his brother’s hair affectionately. “Bye! Ano, happy ka na?” His little brother gave him a toothy grin. Jepoy returned the smile and pinched his brother’s check before opening the door. “Take care of Lolo ha?” “Deal! Bring pasalubong later Kuya!” Jepoy shook his head and chuckled as he closed the door. He glanced at his watch and suddenly swore. He was going to be late for his first day of class!QUESTIONS:  1.

                            9. ANSWER PLSSS ASAP Text A I firmly believe that there is a colony of goblins living inside the moon, and the government is keeping this information from you. How do we know this ? Look at the moon! See that little squiggle? You were taught that was just a crater, but it isn't. It is actually actually the tip of an enermous goblin moon base. How do I know that? the goblins told me so. I have special phone line from my house to the moon- goblins, and through me, they can answer any question you've got. Our moon-door is always open, the goblins tell me. Text B Earth has just one moon - a rocky, cratered place, roughly a quarter the size of Earth and an average of 238,855 miles away. The Moon can be seen with the naked eye most nights as it traces its 27-day orbit around our planet. Chances are that when you imagine the night sky, one of the first things that comes to mind is the Moon "glowing" in the darkness. The Moon has always held a special place in our imaginations and in daily life. It's no wonder that we are fascinated. The Moon is Earth's only natural satellite and one that we can easily see most nights. What makes the Moon glow? The Moon does not shine with its own light. It simply reflects light coming shape each night from the Sun. Why does it look like the Moon is changing shape? From Earth, it might look like the Moon is our spot on Earth, we see - from a tiny sliver to a half moon to a full moon and back again. What's actually happening is that from different parts of the Moon lit up by the Sun as the Moon travels in its orbit. Is there actually a "dark side" of the Moon? No. The Moon rotates on its own axis at the same rate that it orbits around Earth. That means we always see the same side of the Moon from our position on Earth. The side we don't see gets just as much light, so a more accurate name for that part of the Moon is the "far side. "Even thousands of years ago, humans drew pictures to track the changes of the Moon. Later, people used their observations of the Moon to create calendars. Today, we study the Moon using telescopes and spacecraft. For example, NASA's Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter has been circling the Moon and sending back measurements since 2009. The Moon is the only other planetary body that humans have visited. On July 20, 1969, NASA astronauts Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin were the first people to set foot on the dusty surface of the Moon. Ten other American astronauts followed. They collected hundreds of pounds of lunar soil and rock samples, conducted experiments and installed equipment for follow-up measurements. Using a Venn Diagram compare the two text. Refer to the comprehensive questions below as your guide in writing the content of your diagram. 1. What are the difference between two passages? 2. What are the similarities of the two passages? 3. What is the authors point of view or claims on the first passage? How about for the second author? 4.What are the pieces of evidence that each author shown that their claim is accurate​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Text A:</p><p></p><p>Differences:</p><p>- The author claims that there is a colony of goblins living inside the moon, while text B only provides factual information about the moon.</p><p>- The author of text A claims that the government is keeping this information from the readers.</p><p>- The author of text A claims to have a special phone line to communicate with the goblins living on the moon.</p><p></p><p>Similarities:</p><p>- Both texts are about the moon.</p><p>- Both texts mention that the moon is Earth's only natural satellite.</p><p>- Both texts mention that the moon reflects light from the Sun.</p><p></p><p>Author's point of view or claims:</p><p>- The author of text A believes that there is a colony of goblins living inside the moon, and that the government is keeping this information from the readers.</p><p>- The author of text B presents factual information about the moon without making any claims or expressing a personal point of view.</p><p></p><p>Evidence:</p><p>- The author of text A claims that there is a squiggle on the moon, which they believe is the tip of an enormous goblin moon base. However, no evidence is provided to support this claim, aside from the author's own communication with the goblins living on the moon.</p><p>- The author of text B provides factual information and cites NASA's Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter as an example of a spacecraft that has been circling the moon and sending back measurements. They also mention the moon landings conducted by American astronauts and the collection of lunar soil and rock samples as evidence of human exploration of the moon.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>1. The first passage discusses the belief in a colony of goblins living inside the moon, while the second passage provides factual information about the moon such as its size, distance from Earth, and the way it reflects light from the sun. The first passage is also more imaginative and unrealistic compared to the second passage. </p><p>2. Both passages talk about the moon and its significance in human history. They both also explain how the moon appears to change shape from Earth and clarify that the moon does not shine with its own light. </p><p>3. The author of the first passage has a belief in a colony of goblins living inside the moon, and they claim that the government is hiding this information. The author of the second passage presents factual information and does not express any belief or point of view.</p><p>4. The first author provides no evidence for their claim, aside from saying that the goblins have told them so through a special phone line. The second author provides evidence such as the Moon's size, distance from Earth, the way it reflects light, and information on human exploration of the Moon, including the lunar missions conducted by NASA.</p><p></p><p>Consider</p><p><strong>•Brainliest - Choose this answer as the best answer if you think it is the most helpful and informative.</strong></p><p></p><p>•Upvote/like - Show appreciation for the answer by clicking the upvote or like button.</p><p></p><p>•Comment/critique - Give constructive feedback on the answer, pointing out what is correct and what can be improved.</p><p></p><p>•Rate - Rate the answer on a scale of 1 to 5 based on how helpful it was.</p><p></p><p><strong>•Follow - Click the "Follow" button to stay updated on future answers and posts by the author.</strong></p><p></p><p>#Lazy learning to the rescue</p><p>#God bless</p><p>#Learning fast and easy</p><p>#Accurate answer</p><p>#Chillax</p><p></p><p></p><br />

                            12. Saturday, April 23, 2020
Today, here at my grandparents’ home, the whole family was up early because it
was our grandfather’s birthday. We looked forward to spending our time here at the
farm. The landscape was refreshing to our eyes. When the sun shone in the morning or
before sunset, it made the rice fields much golden as the rice were ready for harvest.
Fruit trees abounded and full of ripe fruits making our mouths watery with anticipation.
The sound on the farm was relaxing and the breeze was soothing to our senses. After
waking Lolo up to greet him a happy birthday, we shared an early breakfast of puto,
sikwate, fresh mangoes, fried native chicken and grilled tilapia from the small fish pond
at the backyard. Then, we proceeded to do our tasks assigned for the day. Nene and
Pepe cleaned and decorated the sala. Downstairs were my cousins cleaning the lawn
and the backyard. Tatay, together with my uncle cooked the dishes we would share
later that day. Nanay and I prepared the desserts of suman, buko pie and fresh fruit
salad. Finally, at around 1:00 pm, everything was set. Lolo and Lola were summoned
to the dining room. We ate with delight and shared happy stories and Lolo was in high
spirits as more tuba was poured into his glass. It was indeed fun and memorable and I
looked forward to spending another day on the farm.

Fruit trees abounded and full of ripe fruits making our mouths watery with anticipation. The sound on the farm was relaxing and the breeze was soothing to our senses. After waking Lolo up to greet him a happy birthday, we shared an early breakfast of puto, sikwate, fresh mangoes, fried native chicken and grilled tilapia from the small fish pond at the backyard. Then, we proceeded to do our tasks assigned for the day. Nene and Pepe cleaned and decorated the sala. Downstairs were my cousins cleaning the lawn and the backyard. Tatay, together with my uncle cooked the dishes we would share later that day. Nanay and I prepared the desserts of suman, buko pie and fresh fruit salad. Finally, at around 1:00 pm, everything was set. Lolo and Lola were summoned to the dining room. We ate with delight and shared happy stories and Lolo was in high spirits as more tuba was poured into his glass. It was indeed fun and memorable and I looked forward to spending another day on the farm. Questions: 1. What tense of the verb was used? Give examples of these verbs (at least 3). 2.

                            15. The Boy Who Cried Wolf Once there was a shepherd boy who spent his days on the hills watching the sheep. The boy got bored and lonely on the hill all day with only the sheep for company. I know, he thought to himself. I will call out. Wolf!" and then the others will come running to help me and I will not be alone So, the boy called out, as loud as he could, Wolf Wolf". All the boys and men from his village came running. "Where is the woll?" they asked. "It ran off," the boy said. But one of the other boys stayed with him all the same, and he had company for the rest of the day. A few days later, the boy was feeling bored and lonely again. I would really like some company, he thought to himself. So once again he called out, Wolf Wolf!" and all the boys and men from his village came running. Again, he told them that the wolf had been frightened away by the sound of them coming. This time there was grumbling among the men, who didn't believe him. They were getting angry at having to drop their work and come running for no reason because of this foolish boy still as a precaution, they allowed one of the other boys to remain with him until it was time to bring the sheep back in the evening. A few days later, the boy was once again on the hill, tending his sheep, when he saw a real wolf skulking about the edges of his flock. The wolf was huge, and he had sharp, white teeth and bright, yellow eyes. The boy was very frightened. "Wolf Wolf" he cried out. Wolf!" But this time, no one came. The men in the village, who had become wise to the boy's trick, only laughed. There is no woll." they said to themselves. Meanwhile, the wolf ate all of the boy's sheep 21.
