                                            Eggs are sorted into two sizes (large and extra large) at the Cheerful Chicken Dairy. Unfortunately, business has not been good lately, and since the Cheerful Chicken’s 40-yearold egg sorting machine finally broke down there have been no funds available to replace it. Instead, Old Fred, one of the firm’s sharper-eyed employees, has been equipped with a "Large" rubber stamp in his right hand and an "X-Large" stamp in his left, and is assigned to stamp each egg with the appropriate label as it goes by on the conveyor belt. Down the line, another employee puts the eggs into one of two hoppers, each egg according to its stamp. The system works reasonably well, all things considered, except that Old Fred has a heavy hand and on the average breaks 30% of the 120 eggs that pass by him each minute. At the same time, a check of the "X-Large" stream reveals a flow rate of 70 eggs/min., of which 25 eggs/min. are broken.</a>

Choose the letter of your answer from the given statements. A. Both sentences are correct B. The first sentence is correct and the second sentence is incorrect. C. The first sentence is incorrect and the second sentence is correct. D. Both sentences are incorrect. 1. Law of Conservation of Mass states that the total quantity of mass of substance remains constant regardless of any change that takes place. The mass of the reactants must be equal to the mass products. 2. Coefficients are whole numbers written in front of the symbols or formula. Equations can be balanced by inspection, a trial-and-error process. 3. Rate of reaction refers to the speed at which reactant either decompose or combine to form new substances. Chemical reactions have the same characteristics and require different conditions to proceed. 4. Decreasing the temperature speeds up the reacting particles. Reducing the particle size of solid reactants increases the surface area available for collision 5. Concentration refers to the number of particles of substance in a given volume. As reactant concentration is increased, more particles will most likely collide. 6. In a catalyzed reaction, the catalyst is not actually consumed in one step and regenerated next. In effect, it will never use over and over again but is not consumed in the reaction. 7. Many biological and industrial process depend in catalytic procedures. Living things, especially humans, rely on natural catalysts known as enzymes. 8. Spark or friction can also increase the energy of a system and help and generate the activation energy. All reactions have a high activation energy and thus have to be heated to a certain temperature. 9. The subscripts can be changed. Coefficients are the only one to be adjusted. 10. When we have exactly the same number of each atom on each side of the equation, we say that the chemical equation is balanced. An equation is not correct until it is balanced.​</a>

                                            DOH surveillance reporting system defines acute bloody diarrhea (ABD) as "a person with acute diarrhea with visible blood in the stool". Since the early 1900s, ABD was reported as dysentery in the Philippine Health Statistics annual publication until dysentery reporting was merged with diarrhea reporting in 1984. Dysentery is bloody diarrhea caused by any of the following common pathogens: Shigella dysenteriae, Vibrio parahaemolyticus, Clostridium difficile, shiga toxin-producing strains of Escherichia coli (STEC), Yersinia enterocolitica, and Entamoeba histolytica (amoebic dysentery). The mode of transmission is through ingestion of contaminated food or water. Pathogenesis involves bacterial production of toxins which destroy the mucosal epithelial cells leading to inflammation and bleeding. However, acute bloody diarrhea may also be non-infectious in origin. Other diseases that lead to ABD are drug-induced colitis, ischemic colitis, and antibiotic-associated colitis among others. Because the definition of ABD is broad and may have different causes, the number of food and waterborne-related ABD cases reported in the PHS and FHSIS from 2008 to 2017 is unknown. Morbidity case rates for acute bloody diarrhea have fluctuated over the last ten years with a significant spike in 2010 and a rapidly increasing trend from 2014 to 2016, until sudden decline in 2017. Limitations in the availability of peer-reviewed publications explaining the phenomenon suggest investment on researches and improved data utilization and analysis. inflammatory bowel disease, a Source: Department of Health 1.

                            5. Eggs are sorted into two sizes (large and extra large) at the Cheerful Chicken Dairy. Unfortunately, business has not been good lately, and since the Cheerful Chicken’s 40-yearold egg sorting machine finally broke down there have been no funds available to replace it. Instead, Old Fred, one of the firm’s sharper-eyed employees, has been equipped with a "Large" rubber stamp in his right hand and an "X-Large" stamp in his left, and is assigned to stamp each egg with the appropriate label as it goes by on the conveyor belt. Down the line, another employee puts the eggs into one of two hoppers, each egg according to its stamp. The system works reasonably well, all things considered, except that Old Fred has a heavy hand and on the average breaks 30% of the 120 eggs that pass by him each minute. At the same time, a check of the "X-Large" stream reveals a flow rate of 70 eggs/min., of which 25 eggs/min. are broken.</h2><br />

Choose the letter of your answer from the given statements. A. Both sentences are correct B. The first sentence is correct and the second sentence is incorrect. C. The first sentence is incorrect and the second sentence is correct. D. Both sentences are incorrect. 1. Law of Conservation of Mass states that the total quantity of mass of substance remains constant regardless of any change that takes place. The mass of the reactants must be equal to the mass products. 2. Coefficients are whole numbers written in front of the symbols or formula. Equations can be balanced by inspection, a trial-and-error process. 3. Rate of reaction refers to the speed at which reactant either decompose or combine to form new substances. Chemical reactions have the same characteristics and require different conditions to proceed. 4. Decreasing the temperature speeds up the reacting particles. Reducing the particle size of solid reactants increases the surface area available for collision 5. Concentration refers to the number of particles of substance in a given volume. As reactant concentration is increased, more particles will most likely collide. 6. In a catalyzed reaction, the catalyst is not actually consumed in one step and regenerated next. In effect, it will never use over and over again but is not consumed in the reaction. 7. Many biological and industrial process depend in catalytic procedures. Living things, especially humans, rely on natural catalysts known as enzymes. 8. Spark or friction can also increase the energy of a system and help and generate the activation energy. All reactions have a high activation energy and thus have to be heated to a certain temperature. 9. The subscripts can be changed. Coefficients are the only one to be adjusted. 10. When we have exactly the same number of each atom on each side of the equation, we say that the chemical equation is balanced. An equation is not correct until it is balanced.​</h2><br />

                            15. DOH surveillance reporting system defines acute bloody diarrhea (ABD) as "a person with acute diarrhea with visible blood in the stool". Since the early 1900s, ABD was reported as dysentery in the Philippine Health Statistics annual publication until dysentery reporting was merged with diarrhea reporting in 1984. Dysentery is bloody diarrhea caused by any of the following common pathogens: Shigella dysenteriae, Vibrio parahaemolyticus, Clostridium difficile, shiga toxin-producing strains of Escherichia coli (STEC), Yersinia enterocolitica, and Entamoeba histolytica (amoebic dysentery). The mode of transmission is through ingestion of contaminated food or water. Pathogenesis involves bacterial production of toxins which destroy the mucosal epithelial cells leading to inflammation and bleeding. However, acute bloody diarrhea may also be non-infectious in origin. Other diseases that lead to ABD are drug-induced colitis, ischemic colitis, and antibiotic-associated colitis among others. Because the definition of ABD is broad and may have different causes, the number of food and waterborne-related ABD cases reported in the PHS and FHSIS from 2008 to 2017 is unknown. Morbidity case rates for acute bloody diarrhea have fluctuated over the last ten years with a significant spike in 2010 and a rapidly increasing trend from 2014 to 2016, until sudden decline in 2017. Limitations in the availability of peer-reviewed publications explaining the phenomenon suggest investment on researches and improved data utilization and analysis. inflammatory bowel disease, a Source: Department of Health 1. What information does the chart present? 2. Which year had the most number of acute bloody diarrhea cases? 3. Which year had the least number of acute bloody diarrhea cases? 4. What is the trend in the morbidity rate of the cases? Explain. 5. How do you think would these data help in addressing the issue on this particular food and water-borne disease? 11 PIVOT 4A CALABARZON English G8​</h2><br />
