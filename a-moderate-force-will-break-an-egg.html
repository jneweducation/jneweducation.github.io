                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p>An egg that is dropped on the road often breaks than one that is dropped on a grassy area, why is that?  <p>
</p><p><strong>The answer is the letter (b), the change in momentum is less for the egg that was dropped on the grassy area.
</strong></p><p></p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>The reason why an egg that falls on grass survives more often than the one that is dropped on the road is that unlike the hard concrete or asphalt which covers most of our roads today, the grass is softer and so is the soil it is standing on.<strong> A grassy area is able to absorb some of the force from the egg thereby lessening the impact. </strong>An egg hitting the pavement is a sudden change in momentum, the energy is immediately pushed back into the object by the hard surface, this is something the egg cannot handle.  </p><p>
</p><p>Although in reality, other factors may influence the result, like the strength of the eggshell, the thickness of the grass, the moisture in the dirt, and at what height was the egg dropped from? But this result is what most can be expected in a similar situation.  </p><p>
