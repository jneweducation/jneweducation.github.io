                                            ACTIVITY 2. THE GREENHOUSE EFFECT
Directions: Read the selection carefully. Then answer the questions that follow.
Have you experienced getting inside a closed car that's been parked in the sun for a
few hours? Maybe you perspire so much because of the heat. The radiant energy of the sun.
heats the air inside the car making it much warmer inside than the air outside. The glass of the
car windows keeps much of that heat trapped inside.
Similarly, gases in the atmosphere trap much of the radiant energy from the sun that
reaches the surface of the earth. All the things on earth absorb the sun's energy. These warmed
objects radiate heat energy back into space. However, the atmosphere prevents a good part of
this heat from escaping back into space. This process of heat retention by atmospheric gases is
called the greenhouse effect. Without the greenhouse effect, all of the sun's energy would be
radiated back into space, and the earth would be too cold for living things to survive and
evolve. Gases that contribute to the greenhouse effect are called greenhouse gases and include
carbon dioxide.
Human activities release large amounts of carbon dioxide to the atmosphere every
year. Some of these activities include burning gasoline, burning of trees, leaves, woods and
wastes, power plants burning coal, and burning of forests to clear land. Steadily, there is an
increase in the amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. As a result, more heat energy is
trapped by the carbon dioxide and other gases. It could cause the earth to warm. This warming
could change climate worldwide. How rapidly this global warming might occur is unknown,
but a rise in air temperature of 2 degrees Celsius to 40-degree Celsius Cover the next 50 years
is predicted.

                            10. ACTIVITY 2. THE GREENHOUSE EFFECT
Directions: Read the selection carefully. Then answer the questions that follow.
Have you experienced getting inside a closed car that's been parked in the sun for a
few hours? Maybe you perspire so much because of the heat. The radiant energy of the sun.
heats the air inside the car making it much warmer inside than the air outside. The glass of the
car windows keeps much of that heat trapped inside.
Similarly, gases in the atmosphere trap much of the radiant energy from the sun that
reaches the surface of the earth. All the things on earth absorb the sun's energy. These warmed
objects radiate heat energy back into space. However, the atmosphere prevents a good part of
this heat from escaping back into space. This process of heat retention by atmospheric gases is
called the greenhouse effect. Without the greenhouse effect, all of the sun's energy would be
radiated back into space, and the earth would be too cold for living things to survive and
evolve. Gases that contribute to the greenhouse effect are called greenhouse gases and include
carbon dioxide.
Human activities release large amounts of carbon dioxide to the atmosphere every
year. Some of these activities include burning gasoline, burning of trees, leaves, woods and
wastes, power plants burning coal, and burning of forests to clear land. Steadily, there is an
increase in the amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. As a result, more heat energy is
trapped by the carbon dioxide and other gases. It could cause the earth to warm. This warming
could change climate worldwide. How rapidly this global warming might occur is unknown,
but a rise in air temperature of 2 degrees Celsius to 40-degree Celsius Cover the next 50 years
is predicted.
Guide Questions
1. What is greenhouse effect?
2. Which gas is responsible for the greenhouse effect?
3. What activities could contribute to the increase of this gas in the atmosphere?
4. What is the effect of too much gas in the atmosphere?
5. What could be done to decrease the amount of this gas in the atmosphere?</h2><br />
