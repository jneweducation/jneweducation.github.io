                                            What is Difference between Free Hand Drawing and Technical Drawing.Answer.○ Freehand drawing is the ability to draw something without depending on instruments or something else to draw. We guide the drawing process with only our hand, and it depends on our observational skills. Instead of tracing the likeness of a cat, or using instruments to do it for us, we draw it by hand. While. ○ Technical drawing, drafting (Drawing), is the act and discipline of composing drawings that visually communicate how something functions or is constructed.Technical drawing is essential for communicating ideas in industry and engineering. To make the drawings easier to understand, people use familiar symbols, perspectives, units of measurement, notation systems, visual styles, and page layout. Together, such conventions constitute a visual language and help to ensure that the drawing is unambiguous and relatively easy to understand. Many of the symbols and principles of technical drawing are codified in an international standard called ISO 128.(c) Wikepedia​</a>

This is intended to check whether you have a prior knowledge in this competency. Just read and answer the following statements by writing (T) if the statement is true and (F) if the statement is False. 1. Plumbing symbols are used to indicate where the different elements of your plumbing system are located. 2. A plumber makes a plan by drawing his or her plumbing installation. 3. A plumber starts planning by familiarizing all the plumbing symbols that would serve as his/her jumping point to make a plumbing lay-out. 4. Piping layout combines the knowledge of experienced piping engineers and process engineers with a good dose of common sense. 5. Isometric measurement is designed to make a difficult task to draw much easier. 6. There is no need to plan and design plumbing you can directly install it. 7. Valves are used to lose the direction, flow rate, and pressure by opening closing, or partially obstructing fluid flow. 8. Valves reduce or increase a solid flow. 9. It is easy to draw the actual picture of the entire plumbing system. 10. A good plumber can easily install drinking water, sewage and drainage without planning,​</a>

Ancient Greek architectural drawings also lacked a sense of depth or perspective 4. The Industrial Revolution (1760-1850) was a period during which many technological advances were developed 5. This was known as the scientific cut-away' view. This form of schematic involved presenting a twodimensional side elevation view of an object that had been drawn as if sliced cleanly in half down the canter. 6. In today's technology driven business environment, most mechanical drawing is done by computer. 7. Programs which preform mechanical drawing functions include AutoCAD, micro station, CorelDraw, Vector works or Adobe Illustrator 8. Technical drawing, drafting or drawing, is the act and discipline of composing drawings that visually communicate how something functions or is constructed 9. Technical drawing is essential for communicating ideas in industry and engineering, to make the drawings easier to understand, people use familiar symbols, perspectives, units of measurement, notation systems, visual styles, and page layout 10.A sketch is a quickly executed, freehand drawing that is usually not intended as a finished work.​</a>

                            14. What is Difference between Free Hand Drawing and Technical Drawing.Answer.○ Freehand drawing is the ability to draw something without depending on instruments or something else to draw. We guide the drawing process with only our hand, and it depends on our observational skills. Instead of tracing the likeness of a cat, or using instruments to do it for us, we draw it by hand. While. ○ Technical drawing, drafting (Drawing), is the act and discipline of composing drawings that visually communicate how something functions or is constructed.Technical drawing is essential for communicating ideas in industry and engineering. To make the drawings easier to understand, people use familiar symbols, perspectives, units of measurement, notation systems, visual styles, and page layout. Together, such conventions constitute a visual language and help to ensure that the drawing is unambiguous and relatively easy to understand. Many of the symbols and principles of technical drawing are codified in an international standard called ISO 128.(c) Wikepedia​</h2><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:
</strong></p><p><strong>F- fascinating
</strong></p><p><strong>A- accepting
</strong></p><p><strong>M- merry
</strong></p><p><strong>I- important
</strong></p><p><strong>L- loving
</strong></p><p><strong>Y- youthful
</strong></p><p><strong>
</strong></p><p><strong>Explanation:
</strong></p><p>A family is fascinating. A family is intriguing to observe. There is a lot to learn about families. Everyone receives love, attention, assistance, support, forgiveness, and acceptance, whether they deserve it or not. It's one of the finest aspects of having a family. It is also the foundation upon which we learn to provide grace to those outside of our immediate family.
</p><p>
</p><p>Acceptance entails being able to identify someone or something rather than being afraid of them. When we are in a family, we accept our flaws and limitations.<strong>
</strong></p><p><strong>
</strong></p><p>Being a part of a family usually means having a good time, yet this isn't always the case. We are joyous, complete, pleasant, and alive when we are among our family.
</p><p>
</p><p>Family is really essential. The single most essential influence in a child's life is his or her family. Children rely on their parents and family to protect them and cater to their needs from the minute they are born. ... They are a child's first teachers and serve as role models for how to act and interact with the world.<strong>
</strong></p><p><strong>
</strong></p><p>Family is loving. Family is devoted to one another. It was there that we felt loved and cared for. It is a family's first foundation.
</p><p>
</p><p>Family is being youthful. We need to be vigorous, eager, and active as a family. It strengthens our bonds with one another.
