This is an older style of ignition system that uses points, a disenbutor, andan external coil. They're high-maintenance, but casily fixed and pretty cheap. Serviceintervals ranged from every 5,000 to 10,000 miles.2. Is an electrcal device that fits into the cylinder head of some internalcombustion engines and ignites compressed acrosol gasoline by means of an electricspark?3. Is an enclosed rotating shaft used in spark ignition internal combustionengines that have mechanically timed ignition?4. Also called breaker points, act like spring-loaded electrical switches in thedistributor. Its function is to cause intermittent current flow in the primary circuit,thus causing the magnetic field in the coil to build up and collapse when it reachesmaximum strength.5. This is the newest type of ignition system and it's beginning to see verywidespread use on newer vehicles. In this system, coils sit directly on top of thespark plugs, and the system is completely electronic. They require very littlemaintenance, with some automakers specifying 100.000 miles between services​</a>

EXERCISE 3: FILL IN THE BLANKS nstruction: Read and answer the following: _____of our body works in various way in which it generates fuel and uses it is an energy to perform a certain task. Most sources of fuel which are called "substrate" come from the type of food that we eat. 2. The body is capable of utilizing and replenishing fuel in order to extend its effort exertion. Energy system in our body includes the______,______,______and deamination of protein. The first thing to remember is any movement, force exertion, or contraction of the body is due to a molecule called adenosine. 3._______ is the immediate energy system of the body to produce work. ATP-CP system is predominant usually in a high power but short duration type of exercises. 4. _______the next in line to contribute for energy production is the Glycolysis or the Glycolytic system wherein the body ATP through breaking down of glycogen in the blood, muscle, and liver. 5.______ most fast-moving dances involve continuous, dynamic, explosive and quick movements. One example of a traditionally fast-moving dance is the Salsa. This dance involves quick footwork, change of positions and intense rotations which requires intense force exertion that affects the work output of the body. 6. _________these types of dances are commonly performed in social gatherings, traditional events, ceremonies and rituals. The dances are more focused on the interpretation of feelings and emotions. It can be solo, partner or grouped. 7. ________requires a lot sustainable energy to perform in an extended period of time. Zumba is one of the most common dances that involves long-term endurance in performing. It commonly danced from 20-60 mins duration time.​</a>

Is an enclosed rotating shaft used in spark ignition internal combustionengines that have mechanically timed ignition?4. Also called breaker points, act like spring-loaded electrical switches in thedistributor. Its function is to cause intermittent current flow in the primary circuit,thus causing the magnetic field in the coil to build up and collapse when it reachesmaximum strength.5. This is the newest type of ignition system and it's beginning to see verywidespread use on newer vehicles. In this system, coils sit directly on top of thespark plugs, and the system is completely electronic. They require very littlemaintenance, with some automakers specifying 100.000 miles between services​</h2><br />
