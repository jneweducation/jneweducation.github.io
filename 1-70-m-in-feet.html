                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>1. To calculate the total walking area available to pedestrians visiting the circular park, we need to subtract the area of the circular fountain from the area of the circular park. </p><p></p><p>The area of the circular fountain is:</p><p></p><p>πr^2 = π(5m)^2 ≈ 78.54 m^2</p><p></p><p>The area of the circular park is:</p><p></p><p>πr^2 = π(70m)^2 ≈ 15,400.97 m^2</p><p></p><p>Therefore, the total walking area available to pedestrians visiting the park is:</p><p></p><p>15,400.97 m^2 - 78.54 m^2 ≈ 15,322.43 m^2</p><p></p><p>2.

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>1.  To get the total walking area available to pedestrians visiting the park, we need to do the following:</p><p></p><p>Get the area of circular fountain (with a 5-m radius)</p><p>Get the area of circular park (with a 70-m radius)</p><p>Get the difference between the area of the circular park and the area of the circular fountain.</p><p>We need to get the difference of the areas because the area of the circular fountain cannot be used as a walking area. Finding the difference means we are subtracting the area not used for walking from the total area of the park.

                        <p><strong>Step-by-step explanation:</strong></p><p>1. The area of the circular fountain is πr² = π(5)² = 25π square meters. The area of the circular park is πr² = π(70)² = 4900π square meters.

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>1. The area of the circular park is A = πr^2 = π(70)^2 ≈ 15,400 m^2. The walking area available to pedestrians is the area of the park minus the area of the fountain, which has A = πr^2 = π(5)^2 ≈ 78.5 m^2. Thus, the total walking area available is approximately 15,400 - 78.5 = 15,321.5 m^2.</p><p>2. The area of a circular pool is A = πr^2, so the area of this pool is approximately π(3.5)^2 ≈ 38.48 m^2. To cover it, we need a material with an area of approximately 38.48 m^2.</p><p>3. The radius of the pool is 20 feet (since the diameter is 40 feet), so the area of the bottom is A = πr^2 = π(20)^2 ≈ 1,256.64 square feet.</p><p>4. The radius of the clock is found by dividing its circumference by 2π: r = 75 / (2π) ≈ 11.92 cm. The area of the clock is A = πr^2 ≈ π(11.92)^2 ≈ 447.61 cm^2. So the clock occupies an area of approximately 447.61 cm^2 on the wall.</p><p>5. The area of a circle is A = πr^2, so the estimated area of the skating rink is A = π(5)^2 ≈ 78.5 square yards.</p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>1. The area of the circular park can be calculated using the formula A = πr^2, where r is the radius. Therefore, A = π(70)^2 = 15,400π sq m. The area of the circular fountain can be calculated using the same formula, but with a radius of 5 m. Therefore, A = π(5)^2 = 25π sq m. To find the total walking area available to pedestrians, we subtract the area of the fountain from the area of the park: 15,400π - 25π = 15,375π sq m.</p><p></p><p>2. The area of a circle can be calculated using the formula A = πr^2, where r is the radius. Therefore, A = π(7/2)^2 = 38.48 sq m. To find the amount of material needed to cover the pool, we would need to know the thickness of the material being used.</p><p></p><p>3. The area of a circle can be calculated using the formula A = πr^2, where r is the radius. Since the diameter of the pool is given, we know that the radius is half of that, or 20 feet. Therefore, A = π(20)^2 = 400π sq ft.</p><p></p><p>4. The circumference of a circle can be calculated using the formula C = 2πr, where r is the radius. Therefore, 75 = 2πr, and solving for r, we get r = 75/(2π) ≈ 11.93 cm. The area of a circle can be calculated using the formula A = πr^2, where r is the radius. Therefore, A = π(11.93)^2 ≈ 447.67 sq cm.</p><p></p><p>5. The area of a circle can be calculated using the formula A = πr^2, where r is the radius. Therefore, A = π(5)^2 = 25π sq yd. Since we are using an estimated value for π, the area will also be an estimate.</p><p><strong>Step-by-step explanation:</strong></p><p>"Pa, Brainliest po. Thank you and have a great day!"</p><br />

                            30. I.Direction: Put a check (/) before the number if the statement is TRUE and across(X) if it is False.1. A Volume is the amount of space it contains.2. The volume of a cylinder is the sum of the circular base area and the height.3. Volume is measured in cubic units, which means it tells you how many cubes of agiven size it takes to fill the prism.4. The base of the cone is a circle.II.Direction: Solve each problem.5. A tent has a square base. If the square has a side of 3m and theheight of the tent is 7m. What is its volume.6. Stacy is cleaning out her fish tank that is 6 feet long, 4 feet wide,and 3 feet deep. It is 70% full of water and drains at the rate of 2cubic foot per minute.
