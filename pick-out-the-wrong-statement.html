Organisms release stored energy in food through the process ofrespiration4. The chemical equation of respiration is CO HOCHOX Х025. Cellular respiration is the reverso of photosynthesis6. Oxygen is the end product of photosynthesis.7. Plants store excess glucose for their energy need.8. Carbon dioxide is a raw material in respiration,9. Plants are needed to reduce the greenhouse sitect of gases in theatmosphere10. The carbohydrates are used by animals for respiration,11. All organisms use the oxygen from plants to carry out the process ofphotosynthesis.12.ATP is not produced in photosynthesis.13. Respiration occurs in the mitochondria of an animal cell.14. Oxygen plays an important role by picking up electrons hydrogenlons to form water.15. The second stage of photosynthesis uses CO2 to produce glucose.​</a>

Maintenance should be regular and carried out by a suitablyqualified person, particularly brakes on equipment.2. Application of parking brakes prevents run overs, even on relatively flat ground. 3. Missing or inadequate guarding, particularly power-take-offs on tractors can catch clothes, hair or body parts. 4. Working alone decreases risks if something goes wrong. Let someone know where you'll be and when you're due back. Take a mobile or two-way, making sure it is fully charged before you leave and check in. Have an in-house arrangement with the owner or manager of maintaining reasonable contact. 5. Use machinery equipment best suited for the job. You can use machinery or equipment that you have not had training or experience, or without a statutory permit or license. 6. Separate people and moving machinery, including trucks making deliveries and pick-ups. Keep them away from power lines - look up and live 7. Get home-made or modified equipment checked by a suitablyqualified person. 8. Set a good example by demonstrating safety expectations to workers.9. Ensure they are properly trained and qualified, including contractors.10. Relying on someone's (or your own) skill and experience can lead to over-confidence and risk-taking.​</a>
