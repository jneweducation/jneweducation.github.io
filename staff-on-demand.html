                                            What performance appraisal? Jamil Reza, a newly appointed graduate, is a staff development officer in the Melbourne head office of Yarra Bank. One of a team of six, lames and the other staff development officers are responsible for preparing and conducting middle-level management development and training programs. Henry Austin is the manager. Aged 54 years and with 39 yearsâ€™ service, Henry is somewhat of a legend in the bank. Bluff, autocratic, and demanding, Henry is uncomfortable with younger, better-educated employees add their perceived lack of respect. As a result, he is quick to squelch any criticism or questioning of his decisions. Just before lunch one day, James was shocked when Henry entered the staff development office and flicked an appraisal form onto each officer's desk.

Below are scenarios which call for a specific organizational design. If you were the
manager, what is the most appropriate organizational design that you will choose?
Scenario
Best Organizational
Design that you will
choose and why?
1. There are lots of milktea shops which sprout within
your locality. Because of this, you want to have
another line of business which will complement your
milktea business. You come up with an idea of
opening a cake and dessert shop. You hire a cake
and pastry chef and two store attendants. This is in
addition to your existing two milktea shop employees.
Moreover, you will put up two additional stores in the
nearby municipalities. You hire a manager and a
supply officer for each branch and the same number
of employees in the first store. Because of the
growing number of employees, you also hire an
administrative staff to take care of the employment
concerns.
2. You are an overseas Filipino worker who decides to
quit working abroad and put up an agricultural
supply business. You plan to hire one sales clerk,
two warehouse men and one office clerk. You will
oversee the day-to-day operations of the store.
3. Your company knows that your hand sanitizer
sales
seem to have been overtaken by other competitor
brands in the market. The board of directors has
approved your proposal to form a core group who will
conduct a research that will find out the current
demand and trends in hand sanitizers and come up
with a new product. You have instructed the ten area
managers from Luzon, Visayas, and Mindanao to
send the names of their marketing head and company
researchers. The twenty men and women will be the
members of the national product development group
who will be led by a marketing research head.
Although they are assigned to be a member of this
endeavor, they will still report their participation and
accomplishments to their mother branch manager.</a>

                                            Laura is the associate director of a nonprofit agency that provides assistance to children and families. She is the head of a department that focuses on evaluating the skill-building programs the agency provides to families. She reports directly to the agency leadership. As a whole, the agency has been cautious in hiring this year because of increased competition for federal grant funding. However, they have also suffered high staff turnover. Two directors, three key research staff, and one staff person from the finance department have left.Laura has a demanding schedule that requires frequent travel; however, she supervises two managers who in turn are responsible for five staff members each. Both managers have been appointed within the last six months. Manager 1: Kelly has a specific background in research. She manages staff who provide research support to another department that delivers behavioral health services to youth. Kelly supports her staff and is very organized; however, she often takes a very black and white view of issues. Upper level leadership values Kelly’s latest research on the therapeutic division’s services. Kelly is very motivated and driven and expects the same from her staff. Manager 2: Linda has a strong background in social science research and evaluation. She manages staff that work on different projects within the agency. She is known as a problem solver and is extremely supportive of her staff. She is very organized and has a wealth of experience in evaluation of family services. Linda is very capable and can sometimes take on too much.The managers are sensing that staff are becoming overworked as everyone takes on increased responsibilities due to high staff turnover. Staff have also mentioned that Laura’s "glass half-empty" conversation style leaves them feeling dejected. In addition, Laura has not shared budgets with her managers, so they are having difficulty appropriately allocating work to staff. Laura said she has not received sufficient information from the finance department to complete the budgets. The finance department said they have sent her all the information they have available. As staff become distressed, the managers are becoming frustrated. They feel like they are unable to advocate for their staff or solve problems without key information like the departmental budget. DISCUSSION QUESTIONS: 1. How can Laura most effectively use both management and leadership skills in her role as associate director? What combination of the two do you think would work best in this setting? 2. What steps could be taken to build staff confidence? 3. What advice would you give Laura on improving her leadership skills and to the managers on improving their management skills? *</a>

                                            Describe the different types and categories of innovation you know, how do they differentiate the innovations?
Netflix was founded in 1997 by Mark Randolph and Reed Hastings. 
At the time the video rental market was dominated by blockbusters which rendered videotapes of movies for videocassette recorders (VCR's) from high street's video rental stores. 
Randolph and Hastings' new business aimed to take advantage of the recently introduced DVD video format technology by offering a different kind of service. The new technology made movies available on DVD's that were much smaller and lighter than bulky videocassette tapes. This in turn meant that it was now possible for movies to be mailed and as DVD's direct to customers. Randolph and Hastings' new service combined the advantage offered by this new technology with the increasing and availability of the Internet technology, by allowing customers to select the movies they wanted to rent online. This not only did away with the need to operate and staff at a costly network of rental stores, it also meant that Netflix could offer a very much greater choice of movie titles. The initial business model employed by Netflix involved charging customers a rental fee for each DVD borrowed, but by 1999 the company had ditched this in favor of a subscription model that allowed customers to rent as many DVDs as they want on a monthly basis. 
The new business model offered valuable benefits for customers. At a stroke it eliminated this hassle surrounding due dates and late return fees. However it also provided important advantages to Netflix, since it allowed the company to differentiate and profile its customers by how many movies they watched. By February 2003 Netflix’s subscriber network had passed the 1,000,000 subscribers mark and the company was the leading provider of movie rentals. But the technology did not stand still and neither did Netflix. In 2007 it began to move away from DVD rentals and into video on demand via video streaming. As a result, while DVD sales fell between 2006 and 2011 Netflix revenue continued to grow. 
In 2011 Netflix announced a new major addition to its service offering in the form of original content for video streaming. The first manifestation of this was the production of an hour-long political drama series starring Kevin Spacey entitled House of Cards which debuted in February 2013. By April 2014 Netflix had 50 million subscribers worldwide, 32.3% of the video streaming market in the US and operations in 41 countries. </a>

Each year, more than 1.3 million people visits its 71-acre site, which is home to more than 500 animals and 3,000 plant species. Although the zoo is a non-profit organization and is partially subsidized by Hamilton County, more than two-thirds of its $26 million annual budget is generated through its own fundraising efforts. Cincinnati Zoo takes pride in the fact that it has the lowest public subsidy of any zoo in Ohio and generates more than two-thirds of its $26 million annual budget through its own fundraising efforts. In challenging economic conditions, the Zoo wanted to reduce its reliance on subsidies even further by increasing visitor attendance and revenues from secondary sources such as membership, food and retail outlets. This would secure the Zoo’s future and enable it to continue its pioneering work in conservation, preservation and research. Currently, Cincinnati Zoo makes use of four separate legacy point-of sale systems with a single platform to provide data on all admission, membership, retails and food service sales. To monitor the number of visitors in certain areas, the zoo staff members make their rounds to observe. You have been hired by Cincinnati Zoo to provide them a solution that will enable them achieve their business objectives:        Increase attendance and revenues by enhancing the customer experience for each visitor        Boost sales for food and retail outlets through more effective marketing and promotions        Optimize labor costs by gaining a better understanding of demand patterns throughout the year        Maximize the workforce by identifying areas of the park that are in need of more staff.   Questions:          What are the problems with the current system of the Cincinnati Zoo?          What are the data available to the zoo management and staff?          How can these data be used to help the following perform their work better to achieve the business objectives of Cincinnati Zoo?          Zoo administrators          Zoo staff          What solutions can be provided for the following stakeholders so that the business objectives of Cincinnati Zoo are achieved? Explain in detail the proposed solution for each stakeholder. In each solution, identify which type of analytics will be applied (descriptive, predictive or prescriptive)        Zoo visitors        Zoo management        Zoo staff services​</a>

                                            Case Study:
Lito Catapang, Operations Manager, and Baby Rambo, Maintenance Manager, both report to Dante Montecarlo, General Manager of Asbok Chemicals. Lito and Baby are about at the same age, well-educated and have extensive experience in their respective fields. It would be expected that these two individuals would compliment each other and be the answer to every general manager’s prayer. Unfortunately, that is not the case.
For some reasons, Lito and Baby find it necessary to challenge each other’s decisions and ideas anytime they have a mutual problem to solve, and they argue constantly in staff meetings. Recently Baby Rambo began to talk to peers in an effort to get them on her side. Lito learning of this, went to Dantee Montecarlo and demanded that he call Baby in and tell her to stop. Lito did not realize Dante Montecarlo was aware of what was happening. Nor did he now Dante had just learned that Lito had deliberately change a unit turn-around schedule so that it would fall during a period when the maintenance department already had a peak workload.
The matter has been further complicated by the fact that the employees of the two managers have taken side and join the fray. Productive work has come a standstill.

                                            What performance appraisal? 
Jamil Reza, a newly appointed graduate, is a staff development officer in the Melbourne head office of Yarra Bank. One of a team of six, lames and the other staff development officers are responsible for preparing and conducting middle-level management development and training programs.
Henry Austin is the manager. Aged 54 years and with 39 years’ service, Henry is somewhat of a legend in the bank. Bluff, autocratic, and demanding, Henry is uncomfortable with younger, better-educated employees add their perceived lack of respect. As a result, he is quick to squelch any criticism or questioning of his decisions.
Just before lunch one day, James was shocked when Henry entered the staff development office and flicked an appraisal form onto each officer's desk. Read these and have the signed copies on my desk by two o’clock. Any questions? Good. And don't forget- signed and delivered by two o’clock.’
After Henry left, James turned to his colleagues and asked, 'He isn't serious, is he? This isn't a performance appraisal; it's a joke! 
Ken Yeo, a bank veteran of Jo years, smiled. He wasn't joking, mate. You've just had your appraisal and you had better like it because that's all you're going to get!" 
Questions:
(a) If you were James, what would you do? 
(b) What impact would Henry's approach have on his staff's development, job satisfaction, and motivation, and performance improvement?</a>

One of a team of six, lames and the other staff development officers are responsible for preparing and conducting middle-level management development and training programs. Henry Austin is the manager. Aged 54 years and with 39 yearsâ€™ service, Henry is somewhat of a legend in the bank. Bluff, autocratic, and demanding, Henry is uncomfortable with younger, better-educated employees add their perceived lack of respect. As a result, he is quick to squelch any criticism or questioning of his decisions. Just before lunch one day, James was shocked when Henry entered the staff development office and flicked an appraisal form onto each officer's desk. Read these and have the signed copies on my desk by two oâ€™clock. Any questions? Good. And don't forget- signed and delivered by two oâ€™clock.â€™ After Henry left, James turned to his colleagues and asked, 'He isn't serious, is he? This isn't a performance appraisal; it's a joke! Ken Yeo, a bank veteran of Jo years, smiled. He wasn't joking, mate. You've just had your appraisal and you had better like it because that's all you're going to get!"

A fast-food restaurant is experiencing high turnover rates among its staff, resulting in constant shortages of workers during peak hours. The management team is struggling to keep up with the demand, and customers are becoming increasingly frustrated with long wait times and mistakes in their orders.</h2><br />
                        EMPLOYEE TURNOVER<p></p><p>Based on the case the company is  facing high turnover rates, resulting in constant worker shortages and <strong>frustrated customers. </strong>The 5 kinds of problem that I had identified in the case are high turnover rates, lack of employee retention strategies, poor management practices, <strong>customer dissatisfaction,</strong> and inefficient staffing practices. The management can resolve the issue by giving competitive wages and benefits, effective training and support, and addressing employee concerns. </p>PROBLEMS<p>1.<strong> Employee turnover is high</strong>- The main problem of the organization is that most of its employees are leaving the organization which results in a constant shortage of workers during peak hours</p><p><strong>2. No employee retention strategies</strong>-  The organization has no strategy to make their employee feel contented and happy so that they will stay in the organization.</p><p><strong>3. Poor Management practices</strong>- The management practices of the business is poor  which can lead to staff dissatisfaction and high turnover rates</p><p><strong>4. Customer Dissatisfaction- </strong> SInce there is no enough employees, most of the customers waited for their order for the long time which can make them feel dissatisfied which also resulted in decline in sales because there is no repeat purchase.</p><p><strong>5. Inefficient Staffing Practices- </strong>There is no scheduling of employees which cannot meet the customer demand.</p><p></p><p></p><p>#SPJ1</p><p></p>PROBLEMS YOU SEE IN THE SCENARIO:3<p>Based on the questions, some of the problems and scenarios that can be found:</p>High Turnover Rates - One of the biggest problems in the scenario is the high turnover rates among the staff. Some of the reasons due to<strong> low pay,</strong> <strong>lack</strong> of benefits<strong>, poor</strong> working conditions, or even lack of opportunities for growth and development. This issue needs to be addressed immediately by the management team to retain their employees and reduce the costs associated with training new staff.Shortages of Workers - The<strong> lack </strong>of staff leads to longer waiting hours for customers which are in a hurry, which can result in negative customer experiences. It needs to be assess, implement <strong>strategies</strong> to ensure adequate number of staff that is available during peak hours. Hiring more staff, implementing flexible <strong>scheduling,</strong> and providing <strong>incentives</strong> to encourage employees to work during peak hours which some management overlook this problem.Customer satisfaction - The waiting game and mistakes in their order can  <strong>increase </strong>frustration. This can lead to negative reviews, reduced <strong>customer </strong>loyalty, and <strong>ultimately</strong> a decrease in revenues and capitals.Inefficient Processes - Inefficient processes may also <strong>contribute</strong> to the problems faced by the restaurant most of the time. For instance, if the kitchen is not <strong>organized, </strong>then the result is not that good, mistakes in orders and frustrated customer may increase.Lack of Employee Engagement - A lack of <strong>employee</strong> engagement can lead or may result to high turnover rates and poor service. <strong>Employees</strong> who are not interested in their work may not provide the best service to their<strong> customers. </strong><p></p><p></p><p>For more details about Management skills:</p><p>https://brainly.ph/question/19174379</p><p></p><p></p><p>#SPJ1</p><p></p><br />

Best Organizational
Design that you will
choose and why?
1. There are lots of milktea shops which sprout within
your locality. Because of this, you want to have
another line of business which will complement your
milktea business. You come up with an idea of
opening a cake and dessert shop. You hire a cake
and pastry chef and two store attendants. This is in
addition to your existing two milktea shop employees.
Moreover, you will put up two additional stores in the
nearby municipalities. You hire a manager and a
supply officer for each branch and the same number
of employees in the first store. Because of the
growing number of employees, you also hire an
administrative staff to take care of the employment

3. Your company knows that your hand sanitizer
sales
seem to have been overtaken by other competitor
brands in the market. The board of directors has
approved your proposal to form a core group who will
conduct a research that will find out the current
demand and trends in hand sanitizers and come up
with a new product. You have instructed the ten area
managers from Luzon, Visayas, and Mindanao to
send the names of their marketing head and company
researchers. The twenty men and women will be the
members of the national product development group
who will be led by a marketing research head.

                            20. Laura is the associate director of a nonprofit agency that provides assistance to children and families. She is the head of a department that focuses on evaluating the skill-building programs the agency provides to families. She reports directly to the agency leadership. As a whole, the agency has been cautious in hiring this year because of increased competition for federal grant funding. However, they have also suffered high staff turnover. Two directors, three key research staff, and one staff person from the finance department have left.Laura has a demanding schedule that requires frequent travel; however, she supervises two managers who in turn are responsible for five staff members each. Both managers have been appointed within the last six months. Manager 1: Kelly has a specific background in research. She manages staff who provide research support to another department that delivers behavioral health services to youth. Kelly supports her staff and is very organized; however, she often takes a very black and white view of issues. Upper level leadership values Kelly’s latest research on the therapeutic division’s services. Kelly is very motivated and driven and expects the same from her staff. Manager 2: Linda has a strong background in social science research and evaluation. She manages staff that work on different projects within the agency. She is known as a problem solver and is extremely supportive of her staff. She is very organized and has a wealth of experience in evaluation of family services. Linda is very capable and can sometimes take on too much.The managers are sensing that staff are becoming overworked as everyone takes on increased responsibilities due to high staff turnover. Staff have also mentioned that Laura’s "glass half-empty" conversation style leaves them feeling dejected. In addition, Laura has not shared budgets with her managers, so they are having difficulty appropriately allocating work to staff. Laura said she has not received sufficient information from the finance department to complete the budgets. The finance department said they have sent her all the information they have available. As staff become distressed, the managers are becoming frustrated. They feel like they are unable to advocate for their staff or solve problems without key information like the departmental budget. DISCUSSION QUESTIONS: 1. How can Laura most effectively use both management and leadership skills in her role as associate director? What combination of the two do you think would work best in this setting? 2. What steps could be taken to build staff confidence? 3. What advice would you give Laura on improving her leadership skills and to the managers on improving their management skills? *</h2><br />

                            25. Describe the different types and categories of innovation you know, how do they differentiate the innovations?
Netflix was founded in 1997 by Mark Randolph and Reed Hastings. 
At the time the video rental market was dominated by blockbusters which rendered videotapes of movies for videocassette recorders (VCR's) from high street's video rental stores. 
Randolph and Hastings' new business aimed to take advantage of the recently introduced DVD video format technology by offering a different kind of service. The new technology made movies available on DVD's that were much smaller and lighter than bulky videocassette tapes. This in turn meant that it was now possible for movies to be mailed and as DVD's direct to customers. Randolph and Hastings' new service combined the advantage offered by this new technology with the increasing and availability of the Internet technology, by allowing customers to select the movies they wanted to rent online. This not only did away with the need to operate and staff at a costly network of rental stores, it also meant that Netflix could offer a very much greater choice of movie titles. The initial business model employed by Netflix involved charging customers a rental fee for each DVD borrowed, but by 1999 the company had ditched this in favor of a subscription model that allowed customers to rent as many DVDs as they want on a monthly basis. 
The new business model offered valuable benefits for customers. At a stroke it eliminated this hassle surrounding due dates and late return fees. However it also provided important advantages to Netflix, since it allowed the company to differentiate and profile its customers by how many movies they watched. By February 2003 Netflix’s subscriber network had passed the 1,000,000 subscribers mark and the company was the leading provider of movie rentals. But the technology did not stand still and neither did Netflix. In 2007 it began to move away from DVD rentals and into video on demand via video streaming. As a result, while DVD sales fell between 2006 and 2011 Netflix revenue continued to grow. 
In 2011 Netflix announced a new major addition to its service offering in the form of original content for video streaming. The first manifestation of this was the production of an hour-long political drama series starring Kevin Spacey entitled House of Cards which debuted in February 2013. By April 2014 Netflix had 50 million subscribers worldwide, 32.3% of the video streaming market in the US and operations in 41 countries. </h2><br />

Although the zoo is a non-profit organization and is partially subsidized by Hamilton County, more than two-thirds of its $26 million annual budget is generated through its own fundraising efforts. Cincinnati Zoo takes pride in the fact that it has the lowest public subsidy of any zoo in Ohio and generates more than two-thirds of its $26 million annual budget through its own fundraising efforts. In challenging economic conditions, the Zoo wanted to reduce its reliance on subsidies even further by increasing visitor attendance and revenues from secondary sources such as membership, food and retail outlets. This would secure the Zoo’s future and enable it to continue its pioneering work in conservation, preservation and research. Currently, Cincinnati Zoo makes use of four separate legacy point-of sale systems with a single platform to provide data on all admission, membership, retails and food service sales. To monitor the number of visitors in certain areas, the zoo staff members make their rounds to observe. You have been hired by Cincinnati Zoo to provide them a solution that will enable them achieve their business objectives:        Increase attendance and revenues by enhancing the customer experience for each visitor        Boost sales for food and retail outlets through more effective marketing and promotions        Optimize labor costs by gaining a better understanding of demand patterns throughout the year        Maximize the workforce by identifying areas of the park that are in need of more staff.   Questions:          What are the problems with the current system of the Cincinnati Zoo?          What are the data available to the zoo management and staff?          How can these data be used to help the following perform their work better to achieve the business objectives of Cincinnati Zoo?          Zoo administrators          Zoo staff          What solutions can be provided for the following stakeholders so that the business objectives of Cincinnati Zoo are achieved?

                            28. Case Study:
Lito Catapang, Operations Manager, and Baby Rambo, Maintenance Manager, both report to Dante Montecarlo, General Manager of Asbok Chemicals. Lito and Baby are about at the same age, well-educated and have extensive experience in their respective fields. It would be expected that these two individuals would compliment each other and be the answer to every general manager’s prayer. Unfortunately, that is not the case.
For some reasons, Lito and Baby find it necessary to challenge each other’s decisions and ideas anytime they have a mutual problem to solve, and they argue constantly in staff meetings. Recently Baby Rambo began to talk to peers in an effort to get them on her side. Lito learning of this, went to Dantee Montecarlo and demanded that he call Baby in and tell her to stop. Lito did not realize Dante Montecarlo was aware of what was happening. Nor did he now Dante had just learned that Lito had deliberately change a unit turn-around schedule so that it would fall during a period when the maintenance department already had a peak workload.
The matter has been further complicated by the fact that the employees of the two managers have taken side and join the fray. Productive work has come a standstill.

                            30. What performance appraisal? 
Jamil Reza, a newly appointed graduate, is a staff development officer in the Melbourne head office of Yarra Bank. One of a team of six, lames and the other staff development officers are responsible for preparing and conducting middle-level management development and training programs.
Henry Austin is the manager. Aged 54 years and with 39 years’ service, Henry is somewhat of a legend in the bank. Bluff, autocratic, and demanding, Henry is uncomfortable with younger, better-educated employees add their perceived lack of respect. As a result, he is quick to squelch any criticism or questioning of his decisions.
Just before lunch one day, James was shocked when Henry entered the staff development office and flicked an appraisal form onto each officer's desk. Read these and have the signed copies on my desk by two o’clock. Any questions? Good. And don't forget- signed and delivered by two o’clock.’
After Henry left, James turned to his colleagues and asked, 'He isn't serious, is he? This isn't a performance appraisal; it's a joke! 
Ken Yeo, a bank veteran of Jo years, smiled. He wasn't joking, mate. You've just had your appraisal and you had better like it because that's all you're going to get!" 
Questions:
(a) If you were James, what would you do? 
(b) What impact would Henry's approach have on his staff's development, job satisfaction, and motivation, and performance improvement?</h2><br />
