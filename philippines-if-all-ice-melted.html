                                            The energy from the 1____________________ powers the water cycle. When the sun warms the water in oceans and other bodies of water, evaporation takes place. Evaporation is the process of changing water in liquid form into 2____________________. Following evaporation is the process called 3____________________, where water vapor changes into water in liquid form. Evaporation, however, is not limited to ejecting water molecules from the oceans. Water from the plants may also evaporate through the process called 4____________________. Additionally, water in solid form such as ice caps and glaciers may not necessarily melt to be converted into water vapor during evaporation. This process of evaporating glaciers is known as 5____________________. Lump together, evaporation from all possible water sources is categorized as 6____________________. Water vapor in the air cools as it rises forming tiny droplets in the sky which we see as 7____________________. As water gathers in the clouds, it becomes heavier. Once the air currents can no longer keep it aloft, 8____________________ takes place. This can come in different forms. In the Philippines, 9____________________ is its common form. During precipitation, water can land in different areas. Some may fall back to the seas; some may fall on the ground where it seeps into the soil. Water from precipitation that is not absorbed by the ground becomes surface water commonly known as 10. ____________________. This will find its way back to the seas by traveling toward the lowest part of the land. Water absorbed by the ground during precipitation moves downward dissolving salts and minerals through spaces between the soil and porous rocks in the process called 11____________________. This is possible after the downward entry of water into the soil or rock surface known as 12____________________. Precipitation that has infiltrated the soil surface will be collected in empty spaces underground forming 13____________________. Water from this area may naturally be filtered through 14____________________ by forcing it to pass through small pores and between sediments. This is the reason why they are known
 as good sources of drinking water. However, they may be depleted if water percolating from above is being removed faster than it is being replenished. This is the water cycle.

                            5. The energy from the 1____________________ powers the water cycle. When the sun warms the water in oceans and other bodies of water, evaporation takes place. Evaporation is the process of changing water in liquid form into 2____________________. Following evaporation is the process called 3____________________, where water vapor changes into water in liquid form. Evaporation, however, is not limited to ejecting water molecules from the oceans. Water from the plants may also evaporate through the process called 4____________________. Additionally, water in solid form such as ice caps and glaciers may not necessarily melt to be converted into water vapor during evaporation. This process of evaporating glaciers is known as 5____________________. Lump together, evaporation from all possible water sources is categorized as 6____________________. Water vapor in the air cools as it rises forming tiny droplets in the sky which we see as 7____________________. As water gathers in the clouds, it becomes heavier. Once the air currents can no longer keep it aloft, 8____________________ takes place. This can come in different forms. In the Philippines, 9____________________ is its common form. During precipitation, water can land in different areas. Some may fall back to the seas; some may fall on the ground where it seeps into the soil. Water from precipitation that is not absorbed by the ground becomes surface water commonly known as 10. ____________________. This will find its way back to the seas by traveling toward the lowest part of the land. Water absorbed by the ground during precipitation moves downward dissolving salts and minerals through spaces between the soil and porous rocks in the process called 11____________________. This is possible after the downward entry of water into the soil or rock surface known as 12____________________. Precipitation that has infiltrated the soil surface will be collected in empty spaces underground forming 13____________________. Water from this area may naturally be filtered through 14____________________ by forcing it to pass through small pores and between sediments. This is the reason why they are known
 as good sources of drinking water. However, they may be depleted if water percolating from above is being removed faster than it is being replenished. This is the water cycle. Also known as the 15____________________.AquifersHydrologic CycleRunoffCloudsInfiltrationSublimationCondensationPercolationSunEvapotranspirationPrecipitationTranspirationGroundwaterRainWater vapor​</h2><br />
