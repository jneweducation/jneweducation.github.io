                                            QuestionCase Study: Solid IndustriesSolid Industries is a manufacturer of cylinder liners. Their products are mainly rejected due to defects arising in the assembly section and casting section of the company's production process. The defects in the assembly section are generally, undersize of outer diameter, oversize of inner diameter, and unproportioned collar or width. In the like manner, the defects in the casting section generally involves cracks, hardness, porosity, or evident holes in the produced cylinders. Hence, it is necessary for the company to reduce the cost of rework due to defects in assembly and casting section to improve the quality of their products.The company also targets to increase their sales in the market to gain a significant market share. Solid Industries know that they can only move forward to their goals if they will be able to find a way to achieve good quality products and operational efficiency through maximized productivity and reduced internal costs. Under these circumstances, the company established three (3) major objectives: to improve the overall efficiency of the system in assembly and casting section; to maximize output per section with less defects; and to modify the production process for better understanding and execution. Follow the suggested outline below in answering the case study:I. Backgrounda. It must include a brief summary of the organizational issue. II. Statement of the Problem a. How can Solid Industries improve the overall efficiency of their system in assembly and casting section? b. How can control charts contribute in maximizing the output produced in the different sections of the production process of Solid Industries with less defects? c. What steps should Solid Industries employ in order to modify their existing production process? III. Alternative Courses of Actiona. It must contain at least two (2) courses of action for every point stated in the statement of the problem. It must also present the advantages and disadvantages of each course of action in resolving the organizational problems. IV. Recommendationa. It must present the best course of action among the presented alternatives in resolving each organizational problem. ﻿ ​</a>

                                            : Solid Industries
Solid Industries is a manufacturer of cylinder liners. Their products are mainly rejected due to defects 
arising in the assembly section and casting section of the company’s production process. The defects in 
the assembly section are generally, undersize of outer diameter, oversize of inner diameter, and 
unproportioned collar or width. In the like manner, the defects in the casting section generally involves 
cracks, hardness, porosity, or evident holes in the produced cylinders. Hence, it is necessary for the 
company to reduce the cost of rework due to defects in assembly and casting section to improve the 
quality of their products.
The company also targets to increase their sales in the market to gain a significant market share. Solid 
Industries know that they can only move forward to their goals if they will be able to find a way to achieve 
good quality products and operational efficiency through maximized productivity and reduced internal 
costs. Under these circumstances, the company established three (3) major objectives: to improve the 
overall efficiency of the system in assembly and casting section; to maximize output per section with less 
defects; and to modify the production process for better understanding and execution.

                                            pa help plsCase Study: Solar Cell ManufacturerSolar Cell is a manufacturing company based in southern part of Korea that manufactures different types of solar-powered products. They have customers based in the local parts of the country and abroad. The company is growing fast due to the increased demand for non-conventional energy. The CEO of the company associates their success in the use of control charts for their manufacturing procedures which lets them control the quality of their final outputs.Although the company has been quite successful in the use of control charts for their manufacturing operations, it has extended the applications of control charts in their non-manufacturing sectors such as HR and Finance. The reason for this implementation is because of the majorincrease in employee attrition and significantly large budget allotted to several departments of the company. Based on the result of the exit interviews, most of the employees who left the company claimed that they experienced work-life imbalance particularly for the operators since they were required to work in extended hours in circumstances when their substitute partners would not be able to arrive to work on time or would not be able to report to work at all. The minority of the resigned employees thought that they were misaligned and not trained for their job, they felt undervalued and afraid that growth opportunities were not present in the company. Another problem area that the top management has observed involves the finance team of the company. The management have found out that allotted budgets in some departments or work units of the firm are unrealistic, inaccurate, and unreasonable. After reviewing all the problem areas of the organization, the company’s quality assurance team suggested the use of control charts in the two (2) departments where the problems are prevalent.However, another difficult situation arises due to the resistance of the employees toward the use of control charts which gains several complaints from the employees pertaining to exhausting additional workload since they would have to monitor and notate the different outflows and inflows in their major and minor day-to-day operations. There was a clear lack of understanding of the benefits of control charts and the need for change using control charts as a catalyst for change. The senior management team decided to provide a one-day awareness program for the HR and Finance people so that they can understand the expectations and the need for the control chart initiative within the company. Moreover, an executive awareness was also introduced to all senior management team so that they would understand the importance and benefits of control charts in the business.​Follow the suggested outline below in answering the case study:

                            8. QuestionCase Study: Solid IndustriesSolid Industries is a manufacturer of cylinder liners. Their products are mainly rejected due to defects arising in the assembly section and casting section of the company's production process. The defects in the assembly section are generally, undersize of outer diameter, oversize of inner diameter, and unproportioned collar or width. In the like manner, the defects in the casting section generally involves cracks, hardness, porosity, or evident holes in the produced cylinders. Hence, it is necessary for the company to reduce the cost of rework due to defects in assembly and casting section to improve the quality of their products.The company also targets to increase their sales in the market to gain a significant market share. Solid Industries know that they can only move forward to their goals if they will be able to find a way to achieve good quality products and operational efficiency through maximized productivity and reduced internal costs. Under these circumstances, the company established three (3) major objectives: to improve the overall efficiency of the system in assembly and casting section; to maximize output per section with less defects; and to modify the production process for better understanding and execution. Follow the suggested outline below in answering the case study:I. Backgrounda. It must include a brief summary of the organizational issue. II. Statement of the Problem a. How can Solid Industries improve the overall efficiency of their system in assembly and casting section? b. How can control charts contribute in maximizing the output produced in the different sections of the production process of Solid Industries with less defects? c. What steps should Solid Industries employ in order to modify their existing production process? III. Alternative Courses of Actiona. It must contain at least two (2) courses of action for every point stated in the statement of the problem. It must also present the advantages and disadvantages of each course of action in resolving the organizational problems. IV. Recommendationa. It must present the best course of action among the presented alternatives in resolving each organizational problem. ﻿ ​</h2><br />

                            19. pa help plsCase Study: Solar Cell ManufacturerSolar Cell is a manufacturing company based in southern part of Korea that manufactures different types of solar-powered products. They have customers based in the local parts of the country and abroad. The company is growing fast due to the increased demand for non-conventional energy. The CEO of the company associates their success in the use of control charts for their manufacturing procedures which lets them control the quality of their final outputs.Although the company has been quite successful in the use of control charts for their manufacturing operations, it has extended the applications of control charts in their non-manufacturing sectors such as HR and Finance. The reason for this implementation is because of the majorincrease in employee attrition and significantly large budget allotted to several departments of the company. Based on the result of the exit interviews, most of the employees who left the company claimed that they experienced work-life imbalance particularly for the operators since they were required to work in extended hours in circumstances when their substitute partners would not be able to arrive to work on time or would not be able to report to work at all. The minority of the resigned employees thought that they were misaligned and not trained for their job, they felt undervalued and afraid that growth opportunities were not present in the company. Another problem area that the top management has observed involves the finance team of the company. The management have found out that allotted budgets in some departments or work units of the firm are unrealistic, inaccurate, and unreasonable. After reviewing all the problem areas of the organization, the company’s quality assurance team suggested the use of control charts in the two (2) departments where the problems are prevalent.However, another difficult situation arises due to the resistance of the employees toward the use of control charts which gains several complaints from the employees pertaining to exhausting additional workload since they would have to monitor and notate the different outflows and inflows in their major and minor day-to-day operations. There was a clear lack of understanding of the benefits of control charts and the need for change using control charts as a catalyst for change. The senior management team decided to provide a one-day awareness program for the HR and Finance people so that they can understand the expectations and the need for the control chart initiative within the company. Moreover, an executive awareness was also introduced to all senior management team so that they would understand the importance and benefits of control charts in the business.​Follow the suggested outline below in answering the case study:
