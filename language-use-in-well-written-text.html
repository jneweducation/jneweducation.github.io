                            5. Write an essay, on a piece of paper, about  Parents' decisions are final.. Consider the proper language use as a property of a well-written text.   ​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Parents are often considered the first teachers and role models for their children. As such, they are entrusted with the responsibility of making important decisions on behalf of their children, including decisions related to their education, health, safety, and overall well-being. It is a widely accepted fact that parents' decisions are final and should be respected by their children.</p><p></p><p>One of the primary reasons why parents' decisions are final is because they have a deeper understanding of their children's needs, desires, and limitations. They have spent years observing their children, nurturing them, and understanding their strengths and weaknesses. Therefore, parents are better equipped to make informed decisions that take into account their children's best interests.</p><p></p><p>Another reason why parents' decisions are final is that they have the legal and moral responsibility to ensure that their children are safe and protected. They are accountable for their children's actions and well-being, and thus, it is their responsibility to make decisions that keep their children safe and secure.</p><p></p><p>Furthermore, parents' decisions are often based on their life experiences, values, and beliefs. They have a unique perspective on life, which is influenced by their cultural, social, and economic backgrounds. Thus, parents are more likely to make decisions that align with their children's upbringing and future prospects.</p><p></p><p>It is essential to respect parents' decisions because it strengthens the bond between parents and their children. By acknowledging and accepting their decisions, children show that they trust and respect their parents' authority. This, in turn, helps parents to maintain control over their children's lives and guide them towards a better future.</p><p></p><p>In conclusion, parents' decisions are final, and it is crucial to respect them. Parents have a deeper understanding of their children's needs, and they have the legal and moral responsibility to ensure their safety and well-being. By respecting their decisions, children can strengthen their bond with their parents and benefit from their guidance and wisdom.</p><p></p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p><strong>ORGANIZATION OF BIRD'S EYE:</strong></p><p></p><p>organization. you're leading is crucial. It's this bird's-eye view that will </p><p>enable you to effectively direct, guide and facilitate what's needed to </p><p>successfully strengthen and grow the business.</p><p>When leaders find themselves overly engaged in a particular aspect of the </p><p>business, they may lose sight of the bigger picture. Although there are times </p><p>when focused attention may be necessary, a leader's prolonged shortsightedness can weaken the momentum of a thriving organization, or worse, </p><p>generate dysfunctional communications and operations. Individual </p><p>contributors, as well as managers, are required to focus on a particular </p><p>project or department within an organization. It's the leader of the </p><p>organization who is responsible for setting expectations and standards for </p><p>interdepartmental communications that will minimize noncooperation and </p><p>maximize collaboration.</p><p></p><p><strong>COHERENCE OF BIRD'S EYE:</strong></p><p></p><p>Perhaps the biggest confusion for me was the difference between cohesion and coherence, and in particular how they are modeled. The intro does a good job of describing the two concepts, and making the contrast between local and global coherence, but when I was reading 3.1 I kept thinking this was describing cohesion ("T that follows S in the data" - sounds local, no?). And then 3.2 seems to suggest that coherence and cohesion essentially are being modeled in the same way, except shuffling happens on the word level? I suppose what I was expecting was some attempt at a global model for coherence which goes beyond just looking at consecutive sentence pairs.</p><p></p><p><strong>LANGUAGE USE OF BIRD'S EYE:</strong></p><p></p><p>This brings us to analysis that uses computer- aided tools to offer us a view of language patterns across texts—a bird's eye view of written .</p><p></p><p><strong>MECHANIC'S OF BIRD'S EYE:</strong></p><p></p><p>All proposals of phase-space models for quantum mechanics are classified into two well-defined classes and then described in terms of operational statistical theories.</p><p></p><p><strong>COHESION OF BIRDS EYE:</strong></p><p></p><p>We encode linguistic properties, such as, coherence and cohesion, into expert discriminators and improve text generation.</p><p></p><p></p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p><strong>#</strong><strong>CARRY ON LEARNING ✨✨</strong></p><br />

The book is divided into three parts and takes us through the author's early life, her journey to becoming a renowned violinist, and her decision to step away from the stage. In this critique, I will analyze the book's key claims, properties of well-written text, context, and language use. Claims One of the book's key claims is that following one's passion can lead to both joy and pain. Gonzalez's love for music is evident throughout the book, but it is also clear that this love came with sacrifices. From her childhood in Venezuela, where her mother had to make ends meet by selling cosmetics, to her time studying at the Juilliard School in New York, Gonzalez had to fight against financial constraints, social prejudices, and the pressure to succeed. Another claim the book makes is that the pursuit of excellence is a never-ending journey. Gonzalez's decision to leave the stage and devote her time to teaching is not a sign of defeat, but rather a recognition that there is always more to learn and explore. As she explains, “Performing on stage was always a process of evolution, but it came to a point where I began to think that I had said enough on my violin. I decided that it was time to speak through the violins of others" (Gonzalez, 2019, p. 215). A final claim of the book is the power of music to connect people across cultures and languages. Gonzalez's ability to communicate through her music enabled her to connect with audiences all over the world, from the streets of Caracas to the concert halls of Vienna. Her belief in the universal language of music is reflected in the title of her book, "Appasionato", which is an Italian term that means "with passion". Properties of Well-Written Text "Appasionato" is well-written, with clear and concise language that makes it easy to follow the author's story. The book's structure is also well thought-out, with each chapter providing a new insight into the author's journey. The use of personal anecdotes and quotes from famous musicians such as Itzhak Perlman and Yo-Yo Ma adds depth to the book and highlights the importance of mentorship and community in the world of music. The book is also emotionally powerful, as Gonzalez's honesty and vulnerability allow readers to connect with her on a personal level. Whether she is describing the joy of playing music with her mother or the sadness of losing her father, Gonzalez's writing is heartfelt and genuine. Context "Appasionato" is set against the backdrop of significant historical events such as the Cold War and the rise of Hugo Chavez in Venezuela. Gonzalez's experiences growing up in Venezuela, where classical music was not always valued, provide valuable insights into the challenges of pursuing a career in music in a society that does not always recognize its importance. At the same time, the book also highlights the opportunities that globalization has provided for musicians. Through her travels to countries such as Japan and China, Gonzalez shows how music can transcend boundaries and connect people from different cultures. Language Use The language in "Appasionato" is lyrical and sophisticated, which is fitting for a memoir written by a musician. Gonzalez uses vivid imagery and sensory detail to bring her experiences to life, whether she is describing the lush landscapes of Venezuela or the acoustics of a concert hall. At the same time, Gonzalez's writing is also accessible and easy to understand. She avoids technical jargon and explains musical concepts in a way that is understandable even for those who may not have a background in music. Conclusion "Appasionato" by Barbara Gonzalez is a well-crafted and emotionally powerful memoir that offers valuable insights into the life of a musician. Through her personal story, Gonzalez makes important claims about the challenges of pursuing one's passion, the never-ending pursuit of excellence, and the power of music to connect people across cultures. The book's properties of well-written text, context, and language use make it an engaging and informative read for anyone interested in music or memoirs. Overall, "Appasionato" is a testament to the beauty of music and the human spirit.</p><p></p><p>#CarryOnLearning</p><br />

The people of the kingdom were very happy as they led a very prosperous life with an abundance of wealth and no misfortunes.</p><p></p><p>Once, the king decided to go visiting places of historical importance and pilgrim centres at distant places. He decided to travel by foot to interact with his people. People of distant places were very happy to have a conversation with their king. They were proud that their king had a kind heart.</p><p></p><p>After several weeks of travel, the king returned to the palace. He was quite happy that he had visited many pilgrim centres and witnessed his people leading a prosperous life. However, he had one regret.</p><p></p><p>He had intolerable pain in his feet as it was his first trip by foot covering a long distance. He complained to his ministers that the roads weren't comfortable and that they were very stony. He could not tolerate the pain. He said that he was very much worried about the people who had to walk along those roads as it would be painful for them too!</p><p></p><p>Considering all this, he ordered his servants to cover the roads in the whole country with leather so that the people of his kingdom can walk comfortably.</p><p></p><p>The king's ministers were stunned to hear his order as it would mean that thousands of cows would have to be slaughtered in order to get sufficient quantity of leather. And it would cost a huge amount of money also.</p><p></p><p>Finally, a wise man from the ministry came to the king and said that he had another idea. The king asked what the alternative was. The minister said, "Instead of covering the roads with leather, why don't you just have a piece of leather cut in appropriate shape to cover your feet?"</p><p></p><p>The king was very much surprised by his suggestion and applauded the wisdom of the minister. He ordered a pair of leather shoes for himself and requested all his countrymen also to wear shoes.</p><p></p><p>Moral: Instead of trying to change the world, we should try to change ourselves.</p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p> A well-written text is <strong>a method of expressing and communicating one's thoughts and ideas. It should be well-organized, coherent and cohesive, use appropriate language, and be mechanically neat.</strong>Language use should be considered when writing a text because if not, <strong>it may hinder the smooth flow of your text's message and lead to the downfall of your writing. It has the potential to tarnish your credibility, weaken your argument, or alienate your audience, potentially burying the purpose of your writing beneath 6 feet.</strong>As a writer, I will <strong>cherry-pick my words when writing. I will consider all appropriate language use to effectively convey my message, as well as other aspects of writing a well-written text.</strong><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>You're welcome:)</p><br />
