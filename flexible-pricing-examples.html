He is ingenious, creative, and flexible and can persist in the worst conditions without losing his sense of humor. He has withstood the rigors of centuries of foreign domination. Main statement: ___________________________________________ 2. Progressive walking is a great exercise that can get you into shape. It is easy to do and costs no money at all. It doesn’t require any medical assistance either. You can start at your own pace, gradually increasing the time and distance. People are in good shape when they can cover three miles in forty-five minutes. If you can achieve this – you’ve in perfectly good shape. Main statement:3. Man communicates with His Creator in varied ways. He may fall on his knees and lift his heart and mind to heaven through prayer and supplication. He may perform rituals. He may illustrate his religious sentiments effectively through the medium of music.Main statement: ____________________________________________4. “Digital piracy is not killing the music industry. History has shown that formats shift and change depending on consumer preferences. LP’s and cassettes have been phased out to make room for CD. With the current shift from physical to digital, consumers have the freedom to purchase individual tracks instead of whole albums, a move that explains the drop in album sales and as a result, overall profits.” Main statement: _________________________________________ 5. “When a consumer product in some way harms society, the government often moves to place high taxes on those products to discourage use, for example, high taxes on cigarettes and alcohol. Obesity should be viewed in the same light. With the high availability of soft drinks and junk food at an affordable low price, consumers are all but discouraged from eating healthy. A tax on such products would discourage mass purchasing and positively impact our society by curbing obesity rates.Main statement: pahelp naman...​</a>
