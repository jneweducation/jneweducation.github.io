                                             the following concepts to fully analyze assertions. Common Types of Assertions 1. Fact This is a statement that can be proven objectively by direct experience, testimonies of witnesses, verified observations, or the results of research. Example: The sampaguita’s roots are used for medicinal purposes, such as an anesthetic and a sedative. 2. Convention It is a way in which something is done, like traditions and norms. Conventions depend on historical precedent, laws, rules, usage, and customs. Example: The sampaguita belongs to the genus Jasminum of the family Oleaceae. 3. Opinion It is based on facts but is difficult to objectively verify because of the uncertainty of producing satisfactory proofs of soundness. Example: The popularity of sampaguita flowers is most evident in places of worship. 4. Preference It is based on personal choice; therefore, they are subjective and cannot be objectively proven or logically attacked. Example: Sampaguitas are the most beautiful and most fragrant of all flowers. ​</a>

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p>analogical evidenceanecdotal evidencecharacter evidencecircumstantial evidencedemonstrative evidence<p></p><p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p> 1. Analogical Evidence</p><p>While not a kind of evidence you’d use in court, this kind of evidence can be useful for increasing credibility by drawing parallels when there isn’t enough information to prove something in a workplace investigation. Analogical evidence uses a comparison of things that are similar.</p><p>2. Anecdotal Evidence</p><p>Anecdotal evidence isn’t used in court, but can sometimes help in a workplace investigation to get a better picture of an issue. The biggest problem with this kind of evidence is that it is often “cherry picked” to present only anecdotes that support a particular conclusion. Consider it with skepticism, and in combination with other, more reliable, kinds of evidence.</p><p>3. Character Evidence</p><p>This is a testimony or document that is used to help prove that someone acted in a particular way based on the person’s character. While this can’t be used to prove that a person’s behavior at a certain time was consistent with his or her character, it can be used in some workplace investigations to prove intent, motive, or opportunity.</p><p>4. Circumstantial Evidence</p><p>Also known as indirect evidence, this type of evidence is used to infer something based on a series of facts separate from the fact the argument is trying to prove. It requires a deduction of facts from other facts that can be proven and, while not considered to be strong evidence, it can be relevant in a workplace investigation, which has a different burden of proof than a criminal investigation.</p><p>5. Demonstrative Evidence</p><p>An object or document is considered to be demonstrative evidence when it directly demonstrates a fact. It’s a common and reliable kind of evidence. Examples of this kind of evidence are photographs, video and audio recordings, charts, etc. In a workplace investigation, this could be an audio recording of someone’s harassing behavior or a photograph of offensive graffiti.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>HOPE IT HELPS MAKE IT AS THE BRAINLIEST ANSWER PLEASE:)</p><p></p><br />

Three fixed points can be established within the room, such as the center of the door, the window, and the corner of the room. Measurements are taken from each fixed point to each piece of evidence, such as fingerprints on the window and footprints on the floor. By triangulating the measurements and plotting them on a diagram of the room, the location of the burglar can be determined with a high degree of accuracy. This can provide important evidence in identifying and prosecuting the perpetrator.</p><br />

Draw a logo design that represent your dream/ambition in life. 2. The evidence of elements of arts and principles of design are required in your logo. 3.You can use any object on your logo. 4. After sketching, apply the appropriate colors, space, balance and emphasis in your drawing. 5.Below your design, write a paragraph to convey the meaning of your design.           how to do this just give me an example.​</h2><br />
                        <p>Note: For example, I have a logo design (keep it simple, but not too simple) that represents my dream/ambition (being a teacher) in life. I added a poem about it to make it interesting. If it had color with it, I bet it will look livelier!! But since I'm just stating an example, it doesn't need to be detailed.</p><p></p><p><strong>Explaination</strong><strong>:</strong></p><p>How you do this is really up to you. Just focus on your dream/ambition in life. Maybe, something that you really look forward to everyday! The elements and principles are necessary too so please keep that in mind while you're making this. Then, add in colors and details on your logo! I'm sure you'll have fun doing that! :)☆</p><p>Lastly, explain what your logo is about, since it's a paragraph it should be as least 5 sentences. I hope it's understandable and I hope I helped you on your Performance Task! Thank you and have a great day!! Goodluck, everything will be alright with you and your grades!! Fingers crossed! ✨</p><br />
