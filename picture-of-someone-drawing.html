                                            Many medical tests require drawing a small amount of blood, for example to determine the amount of glucose in someone with diabetes or the hematocrit level in an athlete. This procedure can be easily done because of capillary action, the ability of a liquid to flow up a small tube against gravity. QUESTION: How was capillary action applied in drawing blood using capillary tubes (narrow glass tube in the picture)? Explain using your own words using 3-5 sentences.​</a>

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>I lost my beloved cat, Muffin, a few years ago.

It was so sudden and unexpected that it felt like my world had been turned upside down. </p><p></p><p>The grieving process was difficult for me. I felt so much sadness and guilt that I hadn't done more to help her when she was sick. I also felt angry at the world for taking away something so special from me. It took me a long time to come to terms with the fact that she was gone and that nothing could bring her back. </p><p></p><p>I coped with the loss by talking to friends and family about how I felt, writing in my journal, and spending time with other animals who reminded me of Muffin. I also found comfort in knowing that Muffin had been happy during her life and that she had brought joy to many people during her time here on earth. </p><p></p><p>Although it's been several years since Muffin passed away, I still think of her often and miss her dearly.

Almost every sentence requires a verb. The basic form of a verb is known as its infinitive. The forms call, love, break, and go are all infinitives. ... The verb's past tense usually has the same -ed form as the past participle.

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p><strong>Mechanics of Volleyball:</strong></p><p></p><p><strong>History:</strong></p><p>Volleyball is one of the world's most popular sports and is played by more than 800 million people on the planet at least once a week. The game of volleyball was invented in 1895 by William G. Morgan, a teacher at a YMCA in Holyoke, Massachusetts. He combined parts of tennis, baseball, basketball and handball to create a new game to be played indoors by people who wanted less physical contact than basketball. Morgan borrowed the net from tennis and raised it six feet, six inches above the floor, a little higher than an average man's head.</p><p></p><p><strong>Rules:</strong></p><p>When volleyball was first invented, it was much different from the game today. You could have as many players as you wanted on each team. There were nine innings per game, with three outs per innning. There was also no limit on the number of hits of the ball on each side of the court. Here are the basic rules of volleyball today.</p><p></p>Volleyball is played by two teams of six players on a court divided by a net.The object of the game is to send the ball over the net so that the opposing team cannot return the ball or prevent it from hitting the ground in their court.Each team has three hits to attempt to return the ball.The ball is put in play by a serve that is hit by the server over the net to the opponent.When the receiving team wins a volley, it gains the right to serve, and the players rotate one position clockwise.When the serving team wins a volley, it wins a point and the right to continue serving.The ball must clear the net on a serve.A game is played to 21 points or some other agreed upon number. The team that wins the best two out of three games wins the match.<p></p><p><strong>Terms and Lingo:</strong></p>Ace - When the ball is served to the other team and no one touches it.Sideout - When the team that served the ball makes a mistake, causing the ball to go to the other team.Roof - When a player jumps above the height of the net and blocks the ball.Dig - When a player makes a save from a very difficult spike.Kill - When a team spikes the ball and it ends in either a point or a sideout.<p></p><strong>Pa-Brainliest po Please!</strong> <br />
