                                            15. How is the term greenhouse effect defined in the text below? Is it formal, informal or expanded?Encircle the correct answer.The so-called greenhouse effect is an atmospheric process by which a portion of the sun's heat istrapped within the earth's atmosphere, making the earth's surface warmer than it would otherwise be.Life on earth is possible because there is liquid water, a blanket of life-supporting gases, and a climateneither too warm nor too cold. Human beings may now be altering this balance by adding unusual amountsof carbon dioxide to the atmosphere. This could make the global climate warmer than at any other timein human history. And this change would be irreversible.The atmosphere contains 75% nitrogen, 23% oxygen, with argon, water vapor, and trace gases--includingcarbon dioxide--making up the remaining 2%. Carbon dioxide is an odorless, colorless gas whichconstitutes about 0.035%. It is essential for photosynthesis, the process by which the sun's energy isconverted into forms usable by plants and animals.Carbon dioxide affects the heat balance by acting as a one-way screen. It is transparent to incomingvisible sunlight and allows the sun's heat to warm the ocean and the land. But carbon dioxide moleculesblock some of the infrared heat radiated back into space. This reflected heat is absorbed into the loweratmosphere. This is the so-called greenhouse effect.​</a>

                                            B) Terraformation- the greening of the red planet would be the most ambitious engineering project in human history. This feat may be raising the temperature from-60 degrees to -40 degrees. One way to begin this is to build chemical factories, power them with small nuclear reactors that will pump out greenhouse gases to cover the planet and prevent the escape of heat. Then, as the temperature rises, the atmosphere will become thicker but not thick enough. Hence, an ozone substitute will be manufactured to supplement the atmosphere. When the temperature reaches-25 degrees, tundra vegetation will survive. Later, as the planet warms to -15 degrees, tundra, carbon dioxide, nitrogen, and water will seep from the crust. The atmosphere will continue to thicken and water will pool in canyons. Soon. Mars will have a breathable atmosphere when microorganisms will create soil to sustai plants, and plants will convert the atmospheric carbon dioxide into oxygen. When the temperature reaches -5 degrees, the ice will mekt. Bodies of water will be formed and rain will fall regularly. Trees will be planted, changing the dry red planet into a moist green globe. Terraformation, one of our prodigious dreams, may founder. But suppose it could be done, should it be done? 1. Why is the terraformation of Mars being contemplated by Scientists? 2. What is the key to the terraformation of Mars? 3. What are its stages? 4. Why will carbon dioxide, nitrogen, and water seep from the crust when the planet, warms to 15 degrees? 5. What is the topic sentence? 6 What is the subject?​</a>

I always wanted to see to its beautiful sceneries and sunset. Its high mountains made my heart excited and ponder with joy. The breathtaking sunset is undeniably heartwarming. Its bright light made my mind calm and peaceful. Indeed, an amazing place to relax. - 20. Human health is vulnerable to climate change. The changing environment is expected to cause more heat stress, an increase in waterborne diseases, poor air quality, and diseases transmitted by Insects and rodents. Extreme weather events can compound many of these health threats. Ecosystems are also affected by climate change. Changes are also occurring to the ocean. The ocean absorbs about 30% of the carbon dioxide that is released into the atmosphere from the burning of fossil fuels. 21. First, I always make sure that I clean my hands thoroughly with soap and water. When it becomes dry, I always double check if my face mask and face shield are properly worn, covering my mouth and nose. After a long day, I carefully remove it from behind and discard immediately. 22. We are the Filipinos with a sense of identity. We are the image of our parents and running in our veins are the blood of our ancestors who fearlessly fought for our country. We are the reflection of our culture and tradition. Let us be proud of who we are--for we are the product of the magnificent history of our nation. Let us preserve our customs and ways of life for it is the legacy of our brave people. It is true that change is inevitable. 23. Whenever I try to walk around the nature, it is undeniably impossible not to admire and appreciate the beauty of it. The color brought by the shining sun is definitely adorable. Its reflection towards the lake shines like a diamond. The sounds of the chirping bird is like a song massaging my ears, The fresh winds calmly touches my skin as the leaves from the trees fall down to enrich the soil. The butterflies are gracefully flying as if they are excited to see me. 24. Let us support one another. Through good and bad times, we should stand as one family. Towards the betterment of our community, lets us work hand in hand with God's grace. Let us be responsible enough in all of our actions, nurture the nature as it nurtures us, and most especially, love each other purely and genuinely. 25. The long wait is over! Finally, we are now going to Bataan for vacation. I am so excited that my my favorite things were packed a week ago. When I woke up, I immediately took a bath and changed into sweater. I ate my meal as fast as I could. After doing so, I instantly secured my seat in the van. This could be the best day of my life!​</a>

Greening the Red Planet
Terraformation - the greening of the planet - would be the most ambitious engineering project in human history. This feat may be accomplished in several stages. The challenge is to warm Mars first by raising the temperature from -60 degrees to -40 degrees. One way to begin this is to build chemical factories, power them with small nuclear reactors that will pump out greenhouse gases to cover the planet and prevent the escape of heat. Then, as the temperature rises, the atmosphere will become thicker but not thick enough. Hence, an ozone substitute will be manufactured to supplement the atmosphere. When the temperature reaches -25 degrees, tundra vegetation will survive. Later, as the planet warms to -15 degrees, carbon dioxide, nitrogen, and water will seep from the crust. The atmosphere will continue to thicken and water will pool in canyons. Soon, Mars will have a breathable atmosphere when microorganisms will create soil to sustain plants, and plants will convert the atmospheric carbon dioxide into oxygen. When the temperature reaches -5 degrees, the ice will melt. Bodies of water will be formed and rain will fall regularly. Trees will be planted, changing the dry red planet into a moist green globe. Terraformation, one of our prodigious dreams, may founder. But suppose it could be done, should it be done?

                            2. 15. How is the term greenhouse effect defined in the text below? Is it formal, informal or expanded?Encircle the correct answer.The so-called greenhouse effect is an atmospheric process by which a portion of the sun's heat istrapped within the earth's atmosphere, making the earth's surface warmer than it would otherwise be.Life on earth is possible because there is liquid water, a blanket of life-supporting gases, and a climateneither too warm nor too cold. Human beings may now be altering this balance by adding unusual amountsof carbon dioxide to the atmosphere. This could make the global climate warmer than at any other timein human history. And this change would be irreversible.The atmosphere contains 75% nitrogen, 23% oxygen, with argon, water vapor, and trace gases--includingcarbon dioxide--making up the remaining 2%. Carbon dioxide is an odorless, colorless gas whichconstitutes about 0.035%. It is essential for photosynthesis, the process by which the sun's energy isconverted into forms usable by plants and animals.Carbon dioxide affects the heat balance by acting as a one-way screen. It is transparent to incomingvisible sunlight and allows the sun's heat to warm the ocean and the land. But carbon dioxide moleculesblock some of the infrared heat radiated back into space. This reflected heat is absorbed into the loweratmosphere. This is the so-called greenhouse effect.​</h2><br />

I had the chance to go the beautiful city of Tagaytay. I always wanted to see to its beautiful sceneries and sunset. Its high mountains made my heart excited and ponder with joy. The breathtaking sunset is undeniably heartwarming. Its bright light made my mind calm and peaceful. Indeed, an amazing place to relax. - 20. Human health is vulnerable to climate change. The changing environment is expected to cause more heat stress, an increase in waterborne diseases, poor air quality, and diseases transmitted by Insects and rodents. Extreme weather events can compound many of these health threats. Ecosystems are also affected by climate change. Changes are also occurring to the ocean. The ocean absorbs about 30% of the carbon dioxide that is released into the atmosphere from the burning of fossil fuels. 21. First, I always make sure that I clean my hands thoroughly with soap and water. When it becomes dry, I always double check if my face mask and face shield are properly worn, covering my mouth and nose. After a long day, I carefully remove it from behind and discard immediately. 22. We are the Filipinos with a sense of identity. We are the image of our parents and running in our veins are the blood of our ancestors who fearlessly fought for our country. We are the reflection of our culture and tradition. Let us be proud of who we are--for we are the product of the magnificent history of our nation. Let us preserve our customs and ways of life for it is the legacy of our brave people. It is true that change is inevitable. 23. Whenever I try to walk around the nature, it is undeniably impossible not to admire and appreciate the beauty of it. The color brought by the shining sun is definitely adorable. Its reflection towards the lake shines like a diamond. The sounds of the chirping bird is like a song massaging my ears, The fresh winds calmly touches my skin as the leaves from the trees fall down to enrich the soil. The butterflies are gracefully flying as if they are excited to see me. 24. Let us support one another. Through good and bad times, we should stand as one family. Towards the betterment of our community, lets us work hand in hand with God's grace. Let us be responsible enough in all of our actions, nurture the nature as it nurtures us, and most especially, love each other purely and genuinely. 25. The long wait is over! Finally, we are now going to Bataan for vacation. I am so excited that my my favorite things were packed a week ago. When I woke up, I immediately took a bath and changed into sweater. I ate my meal as fast as I could. After doing so, I instantly secured my seat in the van. This could be the best day of my life!​</h2><br />

Greening the Red Planet
Terraformation - the greening of the planet - would be the most ambitious engineering project in human history. This feat may be accomplished in several stages. The challenge is to warm Mars first by raising the temperature from -60 degrees to -40 degrees. One way to begin this is to build chemical factories, power them with small nuclear reactors that will pump out greenhouse gases to cover the planet and prevent the escape of heat. Then, as the temperature rises, the atmosphere will become thicker but not thick enough. Hence, an ozone substitute will be manufactured to supplement the atmosphere. When the temperature reaches -25 degrees, tundra vegetation will survive. Later, as the planet warms to -15 degrees, carbon dioxide, nitrogen, and water will seep from the crust. The atmosphere will continue to thicken and water will pool in canyons. Soon, Mars will have a breathable atmosphere when microorganisms will create soil to sustain plants, and plants will convert the atmospheric carbon dioxide into oxygen. When the temperature reaches -5 degrees, the ice will melt. Bodies of water will be formed and rain will fall regularly. Trees will be planted, changing the dry red planet into a moist green globe. Terraformation, one of our prodigious dreams, may founder. But suppose it could be done, should it be done?
