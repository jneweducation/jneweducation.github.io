CHED: Vaccination 'additional level of safety' for limited face-to-face classes Arra Perez, ABS-CBN News Posted at Jun 24,2021 03:38 PM MANILA Although vaccination against COVID-19 is not a requirement for the conduct of limited face-to-face classes, the Commission on Higher Education (CHED) looks at this as an "additional level of safety that will facilitate" it. In a press conference Thursday, CHED Chairman Prospero "Popoy" De Vera said this is one of their observations on the higher education institutions (HEIS) that have been allowed to conduct limited in-person classes. "Kasi iyong first batch, kahit na hindi required iyong vaccination para mag-limited face-to-face, ang nangyari, nabakunahan iyong mga estudyante at teacher because they were classified as frontline healthworkers," said De Vera. "So, in this next batch, we are hoping that the vaccination rollout will be faster so we will add another level of safety at the school level." As of June 21, the commission has approved the conduct of limited face-to-face classes for medicine and allied courses in 93 HEIs nationwide. De Vera said they are still collating data from these schools, but preliminary data show there were no COVID transmissions at the University of the Philippines-Manila and Our Lady of Fatima University in Valenzuela. Transmissions have been recorded in some regions, so face-to-face classes were suspended until the school is cleared by the CHED regional office and the local government to resume.​</a>

CHED: Vaccination 'additional level of safety' for limited face-to-face classes Arra Perez, ABS-CBN News Posted at Jun 24,2021 03:38 PM MANILA Although vaccination against COVID-19 is not a requirement for the conduct of limited face-to-face classes, the Commission on Higher Education (CHED) looks at this as an "additional level of safety that will facilitate" it. In a press conference Thursday, CHED Chairman Prospero "Popoy" De Vera said this is one of their observations on the higher education institutions (HEIS) that have been allowed to conduct limited in-person classes. "Kasi iyong first batch, kahit na hindi required iyong vaccination para mag-limited face-to-face, ang nangyari, nabakunahan iyong mga estudyante at teacher because they were classified as frontline healthworkers," said De Vera. "So, in this next batch, we are hoping that the vaccination rollout will be faster so we will add another level of safety at the school level." As of June 21, the commission has approved the conduct of limited face-to-face classes for medicine and allied courses in 93 HEIs nationwide. De Vera said they are still collating data from these schools, but preliminary data show there were no COVID transmissions at the University of the Philippines-Manila and Our Lady of Fatima University in Valenzuela. Transmissions have been recorded in some regions, so face-to-face classes were suspended until the school is cleared by the CHED regional office and the local government to resume.​</h2><br />

                        QUANTITATIVE RESEARCH
<p><strong>Quantitative research</strong> is one of the main types of research, together with qualitative research. <strong>Quantitative research</strong> is focused on the data gathered, transforming and presenting them into graphs and charts. <strong>Quantitative research</strong> is scientific and statistical. <strong>Quantitative research</strong> is classified into categories: descriptive, correlational, ex post facto, quasi-experimental, and experimental.
</p><p>
</p><p>Here are some facts involving quantitative research.
</p><strong>B</strong>. Quantitative study does not deliver in-depth understanding of the problem or study.
<strong>C</strong>. The control group does not receive intervention.
<strong>A</strong>. An example of a research question with quantitative methods is “What is the most popular social media platform used by Senior High School students?”
<strong>A</strong>. The limited participant’s responses to the given questions is what poses as a weakness of quantitative research.
<strong>B</strong>. Being less expensive is not a strength of quantitative research.
<strong>C</strong>. “The determination of the degree of satisfaction of various sectors on the online and modular blended learning” is a descriptive research topic.
<strong>A</strong>. An example of a correlational research topic is “The effects of non-renewal of the ABS-CBN franchise to the average television viewing time of housewives”.
<strong>A</strong>. A correlational research looks at the relationship of one characteristic to another.
<strong>D</strong>. Quantitative research does not help understand the perception of satisfaction of domestic violence victims.
<strong>B</strong>. It is sometimes true that nominal variable is expressed in numbers.
<strong>C</strong>. The independent and dependent variables are never applicable to all quantitative studies.
<strong>B</strong>. Dependent variables can sometimes be manipulated.
<strong>A</strong>. The student’s feelings towards the cat and dog is extraneous variable to the quantitative research.
<strong>C</strong>. The number of views per uploaded video can be considered as a dependent variable.
<strong>C</strong>. The student’s height can be seen as a continuous variable.

So walang lumipad, travel is limited," ani Duterte.Gayunpaman, mananatili naman ang operasyon ng railways pero dapat siguruhin ng Transport department ang social distancing."Pero itong railways sa baba, okay 'yan. At the same time, observe again social distancing," anang Pangulo.Palalawigin din ang suspensiyon ng klase sa Maynila hanggang Abril 12.Suspendido rin ang trabaho sa lahat ng opisina sa ilalim ng executive branch, maliban sa mga health at emergency workers.a.
