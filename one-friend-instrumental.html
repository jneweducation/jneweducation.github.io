                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p> 1</p><p>A harp is the musical instrument that I would associate myself with. For me, the harp symbolises royalty and luxury and exudes beauty and charm, despite being a solitary instrument. In the same way, I think I am a person who can unleash my charisma onto the world, even on my own. Moreover, just like how there is often only one harp (in some cases, two) in an orchestra, just one of me will be enough to influence the world.</p><p>2 I would definitely choose a guitar, the riffs of which are spontaneous and organic - just like how I’d describe myself. Guitarists know how full of melody guitars can be. They also know that they can also hurt your fingers if played too roughly; in a way this is a nice analogy that says I need to be treated with care. It’s also versatile – it can be the lead or a background rhythm. This suits my personality.</p><br />
