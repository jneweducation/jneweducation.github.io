Let's take some time to practice a few of things we just went over. Best of luck!
As you read, make sure you understand the claims that the author is trying to make. Identify and
understand the arguments that the author is making. Look at the evidence presented to you, then
ask questions based on that evidence.
1 Every citizen, should have access to a free, universal health system. This world
allow medical professionals to concentrate on healing their patients rather than
to be cared for and having access to free medical services provides patients with the
dealing with insurance procedures and liability concerns. Each person has a right
opportunity for regular checkups when otherwise they may not be able to afford
them.
2 Universal health care is an impractical system wher total costs end up being much
higher compared to privatized care. Doctor flexibility is decreased due to government
policy and those that are healthy are forced to subsidize the health benefits for
smokers and those that are obese. Everyone should be given access to health care,
but not in a publically-controlled system.
1. Based on the evidence, is there a different explanation or claim possible?
2. Is the evidence convincing and sound?
4.
3. How does the argument/ evidence compare with others you've read?
Are the two paragraphs express the same or different claims?
5. How do they support their claims with reasons and evidence?</a>

                            6. Independent Activity 1. Read and Analyze
Let's take some time to practice a few of things we just went over. Best of luck!
As you read, make sure you understand the claims that the author is trying to make. Identify and
understand the arguments that the author is making. Look at the evidence presented to you, then
ask questions based on that evidence.
1 Every citizen, should have access to a free, universal health system. This world
allow medical professionals to concentrate on healing their patients rather than
to be cared for and having access to free medical services provides patients with the
dealing with insurance procedures and liability concerns. Each person has a right
opportunity for regular checkups when otherwise they may not be able to afford
them.
2 Universal health care is an impractical system wher total costs end up being much
higher compared to privatized care. Doctor flexibility is decreased due to government
policy and those that are healthy are forced to subsidize the health benefits for
smokers and those that are obese. Everyone should be given access to health care,
but not in a publically-controlled system.
1. Based on the evidence, is there a different explanation or claim possible?
2. Is the evidence convincing and sound?
4.
3. How does the argument/ evidence compare with others you've read?
Are the two paragraphs express the same or different claims?
5. How do they support their claims with reasons and evidence?</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>1. Yes, there is a different explanation or claim possible.</p><p>2. No, the evidence is not convincing or sound.</p><p>3. The argument and evidence presented in the two paragraphs do not compare to others you have read.</p><p>4. The two paragraphs express different claims. </p><p>5. They both support their claims with reasons and evidence. The first paragraph states that everyone should have access to free, universal health care and provides examples of how that would benefit those seeking medical care, while the second paragraph argues that universal health care is impractical because it increases costs and decreases doctor flexibility due to government policy.</p><br />
