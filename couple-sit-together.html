Follow this same type of format to write your journal entries. Notice how the journal entry describes everyday tasks and technologies about our present day. Your journal will need to do the same while describing tasks and technologies from the past.Saturday, October 6, 2007What a busy day today! I never had a moment’s rest. The day started with my alarmclock blaring at 7am. I had to be at the Smith’s house by 8am to baby-sit. I really didn’t wantto wake up so early on a Saturday, but I’m saving money to buy a new iPod and couldn’t sayno to an all-day babysitting job.When I arrived at the Smith’s house, both kids were already awake. Madison waswatching cartoons in living room and Jacob was playing with his Legos in his bedroom. Thekids were hungry so I made them some oatmeal in the microwave and we all ate breakfasttogether.We had to leave right after breakfast for Jacob’s soccer practice. Luckily, the Smithsonly live a couple blocks from the soccer field so we just walked there. It was a lot of funwatching Jacob play soccer. He’s very talented. I was worried that Madison might be bored,but she stayed busy by playing her Gameboy while Jacob practiced.When practice was over, we went back to the house to make lunch. It’s always a breezeto make lunch for the Smith kids because they love chicken nuggets and French fries. All I hadto do was pull the food out of the freezer and bake it in the oven.After lunch, I planned a special surprise for the kids...I took them to see the new Disneymovie. The movie theatre is a few miles away from their house so I had to call my mom topick us up in her car and drive us there. The kids loved the movie; they couldn’t stoplaughing. I have to admit that I thought it was pretty funny too. The only bad part was that thetheatre had the air conditioning cranked up and it was freezing cold!My mom picked us up again after the movie and took us back to the Smith’s house. Wehad only been back for a few minutes when Mrs. Smith came back home. I didn’t expect herhome so soon, but she was back early because the power went out at her office.It worked out very well though because as soon as I left the Smith’s, Danielle called tosee if I wanted to go to the mall. I checked in at home to make sure it was ok and then metDanielle at her house.While we were at the mall, we definitely “shopped ‘til we dropped”. I bought a t-shirt,a sweater, a pair of jeans, and some flip flops. I know that I won’t need the flip flops for muchlonger since it’s already October, but they were on clearance and I couldn’t pass them up.Finally after all that shopping, we headed home because I was exhausted. Today was afun day, but I can’t wait to sleep in tomorrow!</a>

                                            Read the selection carefully. Identify the subordinating conjunction used. Encircle the correct answer. Strong Family Ties Filipinos treasure their family above all things in life though we experience some tough times. We see to it that our family is well provided for and is in good, physical, mental, and financial status all the time. When a family member encounters a problem, the other members sit together and help solve the problem. When the children of a couple marry, the parents see to it that the newlyweds are supported. If the newlyweds cannot afford living on their own, then the parents ask the couple to live with them, During the time of old age, the children of Filipino parents take good care of their parents and see to it that they are well-provided for. This is one Filipino value that we treasure most. pa help po need ko napo talaga ​</a>

Solve the following problems:
1. A couple wants to plant some shrubs around a circular walkway. They have seven different shrubs. How
many ways can the shrubs be planted?
2. In how many ways can a family of 8 be seated in a round table?
3. Ten students were playing spirit of the glass. In how many ways can they be arranged in a circle?
4. In how many ways can 4 charms be arranged on a bracelet:
a with clasp
b. without clasp

members.
6. How many ways can 5 men and 5 women be seated at a round table if they must alternate the men and
women?
7. How many ways can eight ladies be seated in a circular table such that:
a. 2 of the ladies must always sit beside each other?
b. 3 ladies do not want to sit beside each other?
8. Peter wanted to paste his stamp collections in a circle. If he has 10 stamps, in how many ways can he
arrange it?
9. In a playground, 3 sisters and 8 other girls are playing together. In a particular game, how many ways can
all the girls be seated in a circular order so that:
a. the three sisters are not seated together?
b. all sisters are seated together?</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p></p><p>1. A couple wants to plant some shrubs around a circular walkway. They have seven different shrubs. How many ways can the shrubs be planted?</p><p>Since the shrubs are being planted around a circular walkway, their arrangement is a circular permutation. For n distinct objects arranged in a circle, the number of circular permutations is (n-1)!. In this case, there are 7 shrubs, so the number of ways they can be planted is <strong>(7-1)! = 6!.</strong></p><p></p><p>2. In how many ways can a family of 8 be seated at a round table?</p><p>Since the table is round, the seating arrangement is a circular permutation. The number of circular permutations of n distinct objects is (n-1)!. In this case, there are 8 family members, so the number of ways they can be seated is <strong>(8-1)! = 7!.</strong></p><p></p><p>3. Ten students were playing spirit of the glass. In how many ways can they be arranged in a circle?</p><p>Since the students are arranged in a circle, it is a circular permutation problem. The number of circular permutations of n distinct objects is (n-1)!. In this case, there are 10 students, so the number of ways they can be arranged is (10-1)! = 9!.</p><p></p><p>4. In how many ways can 4 charms be arranged on a bracelet:</p><p>a. with clasp</p><p>b. without clasp</p><p>For both cases, the arrangement is a circular permutation because the charms are being placed on a circular bracelet. The number of circular permutations of n distinct objects is (n-1)!.</p><p>a. With clasp: There are 4 charms, so the number of ways they can be arranged is (4-1)! = 3! = 6 ways.</p><p>b. Without clasp: The arrangement is the same as a linear permutation since the bracelet does not have a clasp. Therefore, the number of ways the 4 charms can be arranged is 4!.</p><p></p><p>5. In a prayer meeting, Lina wanted her members to form a circle. Find the number of ways to arrange the 9 members.</p><p>Since the members are forming a circle, it is a circular permutation problem. The number of circular permutations of n distinct objects is (n-1)!. In this case, there are 9 members, so the number of ways they can be arranged is (9-1)! = 8!.</p><p></p><p>6. How many ways can 5 men and 5 women be seated at a round table if they must alternate the men and women?</p><p>In this case, we have two groups (men and women) that must alternate in the seating arrangement. We can fix the position of one person (let's say a man) and arrange the remaining people around him. The number of ways to arrange the remaining 4 men is 4! and the number of ways to arrange the 5 women is 5!. Therefore, the total number of ways to seat the 5 men and 5 women alternately is 4! * 5!.</p><p></p><p>7. How many ways can eight ladies be seated at a circular table such that:</p><p>a. 2 of the ladies must always sit beside each other?</p><p>To solve this problem, we can treat the two ladies sitting together as a single entity. We have 7 entities to arrange around the table: 6 individual ladies and the pair of ladies sitting together. The number of circular permutations of these 7 entities is (7-1)! = 6!.</p><p></p><p>b. 3 ladies do not want to sit beside each other?</p><p>To solve this problem, we need to subtract the unfavorable cases from the total number of circular permutations. The total</p><p></p><br />

Your journal will need to do the same while describing tasks and technologies from the past.Saturday, October 6, 2007What a busy day today! I never had a moment’s rest. The day started with my alarmclock blaring at 7am. I had to be at the Smith’s house by 8am to baby-sit. I really didn’t wantto wake up so early on a Saturday, but I’m saving money to buy a new iPod and couldn’t sayno to an all-day babysitting job.When I arrived at the Smith’s house, both kids were already awake. Madison waswatching cartoons in living room and Jacob was playing with his Legos in his bedroom. Thekids were hungry so I made them some oatmeal in the microwave and we all ate breakfasttogether.We had to leave right after breakfast for Jacob’s soccer practice. Luckily, the Smithsonly live a couple blocks from the soccer field so we just walked there. It was a lot of funwatching Jacob play soccer. He’s very talented. I was worried that Madison might be bored,but she stayed busy by playing her Gameboy while Jacob practiced.When practice was over, we went back to the house to make lunch. It’s always a breezeto make lunch for the Smith kids because they love chicken nuggets and French fries. All I hadto do was pull the food out of the freezer and bake it in the oven.After lunch, I planned a special surprise for the kids...I took them to see the new Disneymovie. The movie theatre is a few miles away from their house so I had to call my mom topick us up in her car and drive us there. The kids loved the movie; they couldn’t stoplaughing. I have to admit that I thought it was pretty funny too. The only bad part was that thetheatre had the air conditioning cranked up and it was freezing cold!My mom picked us up again after the movie and took us back to the Smith’s house. Wehad only been back for a few minutes when Mrs. Smith came back home. I didn’t expect herhome so soon, but she was back early because the power went out at her office.It worked out very well though because as soon as I left the Smith’s, Danielle called tosee if I wanted to go to the mall. I checked in at home to make sure it was ok and then metDanielle at her house.While we were at the mall, we definitely “shopped ‘til we dropped”. I bought a t-shirt,a sweater, a pair of jeans, and some flip flops. I know that I won’t need the flip flops for muchlonger since it’s already October, but they were on clearance and I couldn’t pass them up.Finally after all that shopping, we headed home because I was exhausted. Today was afun day, but I can’t wait to sleep in tomorrow!</h2><br />

However, if a pair must remain together, we can count every couple as a single unit. Therefore, there are 5 different ways they could line up. 5 factorial is equivalent to 120. But there are 2! (2 factorial, which is equal to 2) different ways they can also be placed in each couple. The result of multiplying by two in each couple is two times five, two times two, or ten. Thus, the result of multiplying 120 by 10 is 1200.<p></p><p>b.  there are 3.628.800 possible arrangements for them to be placed in a row using the formula.</p><p></p><p>Learn more <strong>about probability</strong> here: </p><p>https://brainly.ph/question/257423</p><p>#SPJ6</p><br />

Strong Family Ties Filipinos treasure their family above all things in life though we experience some tough times. We see to it that our family is well provided for and is in good, physical, mental, and financial status all the time. When a family member encounters a problem, the other members sit together and help solve the problem. When the children of a couple marry, the parents see to it that the newlyweds are supported. If the newlyweds cannot afford living on their own, then the parents ask the couple to live with them, During the time of old age, the children of Filipino parents take good care of their parents and see to it that they are well-provided for. This is one Filipino value that we treasure most. pa help po need ko napo talaga ​</h2><br />
