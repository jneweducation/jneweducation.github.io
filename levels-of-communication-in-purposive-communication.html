                                            Researchers have used cryogenic electron microscopy to show that coronaviruses enter human cells through an interaction with angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). Scientists exploring how coronaviruses like COVID-19 infect human cells have shown that the SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) glycoprotein binds to the cell membrane protein angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) to enter human cells. COVID-19 has been shown to bind ACE2 via the S protein on its surface. During infection, the S protein is cleaved into the subunits, S1, and S2. S1 contains the receptor binding domain (RED) which allows coronaviruses to directly binds to the peptidase domain (PD) of ACE2. S2 then likely plays a role in membrane fusion. 1.

Researchers have used cryogenic electron microscopy to show that coronaviruses enter human cells through an interaction with angiotensin- AE converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). Scientists exploring how coronaviruses like COVID-19 infect human cells have shown that the SARS-CoV-2 spilce (S) glycoprotein binds to the cell do membrane protein angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) to enter human cells. COVID-19 has been shown to bind to ACE2 via the S protein on its surface. During infection, the S protein is cleaved into subunits. Si and S2. Si contains the receptor binding domain (RBD) which allows coronaviruses to directly bind to the peptidase domain (PD) of ACE2. S2 then liicely plays a role in membrane fusion.

                        <p>Topic: Levels of symptoms in Covid-19 suspect, probably confirmed case.</p><p></p><p>Covid-19 is a highly infectious disease caused by the novel coronavirus. The symptoms of Covid-19 vary from person to person. The most common symptoms include fever, cough, and shortness of breath. However, some people may experience more severe symptoms such as difficulty breathing, chest pain, confusion, and bluish lips or face. It is important to monitor your symptoms and seek medical attention if you experience any of these severe symptoms.</p><p></p><p>---</p><p></p><p>Topic: Difference among Enhanced Community Quarantine, Modified Community Quarantine, General Community Quarantine.</p><p></p><p>The Philippine government has implemented different levels of community quarantine to prevent the spread of Covid-19. The Enhanced Community Quarantine (ECQ) is the strictest level of quarantine, where only essential businesses are allowed to operate and people are only allowed to leave their homes for essential purposes. The Modified Community Quarantine (MCQ) is less strict than the ECQ, but still restricts the movement of people and businesses. The General Community Quarantine (GCQ) is the least strict level of quarantine, where most businesses are allowed to operate and people are allowed to leave their homes for non-essential purposes. It is important to follow the guidelines set by the government to prevent the spread of Covid-19.</p><p></p><p>---</p><p></p><p>Topic: Brief history for Covid-19.</p><p></p><p>Covid-19 was first identified in Wuhan, China in December 2019. It is caused by the novel coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2. The virus quickly spread to other countries, leading the World Health Organization to declare it a pandemic in March 2020. Since then, the virus has affected millions of people worldwide and has caused significant disruptions to daily life. Scientists and medical professionals continue to work towards developing a vaccine and effective treatments for Covid-19. It is important to stay informed and follow guidelines to prevent the spread of the virus. </p><p></p><p>---</p><p></p><p>Topic: How to properly use and dispose a face mask.</p><p></p><p>Wearing a face mask is an effective way to prevent the spread of Covid-19. It is important to properly use and dispose of a face mask to ensure its effectiveness. Before putting on a face mask, make sure to wash your hands with soap and water or use hand sanitizer. Place the mask over your nose and mouth, making sure there are no gaps between your face and the mask. Avoid touching the mask while wearing it and replace it if it becomes damp or soiled. To dispose of a face mask, remove it by the ear loops and discard it in a trash bin. Wash your hands thoroughly with soap and water or use hand sanitizer after disposing of the mask.</p><br />

                            17. Researchers have used cryogenic electron microscopy to show that coronaviruses enter human cells through an interaction with angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). Scientists exploring how coronaviruses like COVID-19 infect human cells have shown that the SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) glycoprotein binds to the cell membrane protein angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) to enter human cells. COVID-19 has been shown to bind ACE2 via the S protein on its surface. During infection, the S protein is cleaved into the subunits, S1, and S2. S1 contains the receptor binding domain (RED) which allows coronaviruses to directly binds to the peptidase domain (PD) of ACE2. S2 then likely plays a role in membrane fusion. 1.
