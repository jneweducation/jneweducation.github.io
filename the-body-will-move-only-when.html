The inertia of an object is determined by its speed. 3. Newton's first law of motion is also called the law of inertia. 4. A stationary object resists movement only because of gravity. 5. If the net force acting on an object is zero, its inertia is also zero. 6. Inertia is the tendency of an object to maintain its initial state of motion. 7. Newton's first law of motion applies only to objects that are already moving. 8. The tendency of an object to resist a change in motion depends on its direction. 9. The speed of an object changes only when it is acted on by an unbalancedforce 10. Law of Inertia states that a body at rest will remain at rest and a body that is in motion will continue to move unless acted by gravity.​</a>

Thinking about it. Only women move in at sexual or seductive manner. Why is this the case? (Minimum of 10 sentences for 15 points.)​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p></p><p><strong>Showing off your body is not always just for people to think of it as way of seducting, showing off or trying to emphasize their superiority amongst others. It always depends on that man whether why and what's their certain motive in showing themselves. It might also be that they just really want the world to see that "I've worked for this and I'm confident about my body and myself." It is unfortunate to say and hear that when a woman does this, they immedietly get shamed or thought of as something innapropriate for doing a certain action. I am not trying to attack society but as I've known throughout history, women were treated lowly. They were only limited to certain things and were treated as delicate and holy people that it comes to the point that they were shamed if they do something out of what people will think of them. Until now society has still been this unequal against both genders. Women are greatly affected but as I was saying, men were also shamed and so on due to a lot of people's mindset about women should be superior than men due to the past. But I believe that an equal rights for both genders should be allowed and there should be no shaming on both sides and both should learn how to respect each other as of now.</strong></p><br />
