                                            V. EVALUATIONDirection: Recite the following with the appropriate tone, pace, and pitch.You are a child of the universeno less than the trees and the stars;you have a right to be here.And whether or not it is clear to you,no doubt the universe is unfolding as it should.Therefore be at peace with God,whatever you conceive Him to be.And whatever your labors and aspirations,in the noisy confusion of life,keep peace in your soul.With all its sham, drudgery, and broken dreams,it is still a beautiful world.Be cheerful. Strive to be happy.Max Ehrmann​</a>

                                            The young man engages in life’s battles, facing the challenges of adulthood and independence in the process of becoming an adult.   Father educates his son about the hardships and dangers he may face in life, while also expressing his own fears for his son’s future. Now an adult, he returns to his father as a successful individual.  And the father calls out to the village to come and celebrate with them.This is the state of the world: the world of the child, innocent, joyous and without hardships.Whatever happened in between, the world hasn’t changed.  It is exactly the same world of the child, innocent and joyous, without hardship. And the same knowledge will be passed down from father to son who will face the challenges when becoming an adult.Armed with knowledge the son seeks his independence and steps out into the big wide world,As a young man, he follows life’s paths, confronting his fears, and aiming to succeed.__________________________________________________________Ø Discuss the universal human experience that is revealed in the poem.Ø What details would you include in the statements to add more sense to it?Ø Write a statement or two expressing the deeper sense of the poem, explaining briefly in what way it is true to human experience?​</a>

                                            In the Philippines, one in five people suffers from a mental health problem. However, most of us are not fully aware with the symptoms, and the framework; of the things that we couldn’t see. And usually, youngsters of today, like you, romanticize the things that hurt which causes self- inflicted pain and disappointment. Thus, associating yourself to a mental health problem is not a choice, and is not even an illusion.	However, you are a child of the universe. And you are meant for great things. Now, in your own understanding, make an acrostic poem with the phrase, “KEEP GOING”	No matter what the situation is, keep going.​</a>

                                            Direction. Read and analyse the poem below.Desiderataby Max EhrmannGo placidly amid the noise and the haste, and remember what peace there may be in silence.As far as possible, without surrender, be on good terms with all persons. Speak your truth quietly and clearly. and listen to others, even to the dull and the ignorant they too have their story.Avoid loud and aggressive persons; they are vexatious to the spirit.If you compare yourself with others, you may become vain or bitter, for always there will be greater and lesser persons than yourself.Enjoy your achievements as well as your plans.Keep interested in your own career, however humble it is a real possession in the changing fortunes of timeEsercise caution in your business affairs,for the world is full of trickery. But let this not blind you to what virtue there is many persons strive for high ideals, and everywhere life is full of heroism. Be yourself. Especially do not frign affection Neither be cynical about love. for in the face of all aridity and disenchantment, it is as perennial as the grassTake kindly the counsel of the years, gracefully surrendering the things of youth. Nurture strength of spirit to shield you in sudden misfortune But do not distress yourself with dark imaginings. Many fears are born of fatigue and lonelinessBeyond a wholesome discipline, be gentle with yourself. You are a child of the universe no less than the trees and the stars you have a right to be here. And whether or not it is clear to you, no doubt the universe is unfolding as it should.Therefore be at peace with God, whatever you concrive Him to be And whatever your labors and aspirations, in the noisy confusion of life, keep peace in your soulWith all its ham, drudgery, and broken dreams.it is still a beautiful world Be cheerful. Strive to be happy.Ponder...Having read the poem, which social issues mentioned in the article "Numbers of World Issues will likely be addressed in the poem?

Because they have those powers there comes some responsibility to use them to some useful end, but for most people that means maximizing their personal well-being and personal pleasure.

Read and analyse the poem below.Desiderataby Max EhrmannGo placidly amid the noise and the haste, and remember what peace there may be in silence.As far as possible, without surrender, be on good terms with all persons. Speak your truth quietly and clearly. and listen to others, even to the dull and the ignorant they too have their story.Avoid loud and aggressive persons; they are vexatious to the spirit.If you compare yourself with others, you may become vain or bitter, for always there will be greater and lesser persons than yourself.Enjoy your achievements as well as your plans.Keep interested in your own career, however humble it is a real possession in the changing fortunes of timeEsercise caution in your business affairs,for the world is full of trickery. But let this not blind you to what virtue there is many persons strive for high ideals, and everywhere life is full of heroism. Be yourself. Especially do not frign affection Neither be cynical about love. for in the face of all aridity and disenchantment, it is as perennial as the grassTake kindly the counsel of the years, gracefully surrendering the things of youth. Nurture strength of spirit to shield you in sudden misfortune But do not distress yourself with dark imaginings. Many fears are born of fatigue and lonelinessBeyond a wholesome discipline, be gentle with yourself. You are a child of the universe no less than the trees and the stars you have a right to be here. And whether or not it is clear to you, no doubt the universe is unfolding as it should.Therefore be at peace with God, whatever you concrive Him to be And whatever your labors and aspirations, in the noisy confusion of life, keep peace in your soulWith all its ham, drudgery, and broken dreams.it is still a beautiful world Be cheerful. Strive to be happy.Ponder...Having read the poem, which social issues mentioned in the article "Numbers of World Issues will likely be addressed in the poem?
