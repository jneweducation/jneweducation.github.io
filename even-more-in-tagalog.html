                                            1. “Mother tongue education refers to any form of schooling that makes use of the language or languages that children are most familiar with. This is usually the language that children speak at home with their family. The ‘mother tongue’ does not have to be the language spoken by the mother. Children can and often do speak more than one or even two languages at home.”
2. “Another way to grasp the concept of animatism is to differentiate the Cebuano terms gahum and kusog. Gahum comes closer to the Tagalog galing, acquired power or skill as in the case of politics, while kusog comes closer to the Tagalog lakas, an almost innate power with connotations of dynamism and energy.”

Everyone is different and what works for one person won’t necessarily work 
for another, even if that other person is someone with whom you have a lot in 
common. If someone you know has a career that interests you try and get more

                                            Tagalog meaning of Friendships are ties formed by two or more people who want to interact with one other. It entails taking an interest in one another's thoughts, feelings, and experiences. Friendships are built on trust, respect, emotional support, and admiration. Life's too short to waste your days with someone who make you feel unworthy and unappreciated. Spend it with friends who makes you laugh and feel loved.
I hope you understand how much having you in my life means to me. You have made my problems lighter and my life better. You've been there when the weather was good and stood with me in the rain, you've laughed with me in the good times and the bad, and you've even shared my sorrow. I adore everything about you because you're more than just a friend to me; you're also my best friend and a bro.</a>

Lisan, a humble fisherman, mysteriously disappears for eight years before returning home. Bhatia, the wife he has left behind, has remarried in the meantime, but there’s more, and something irrepressible for him to reclaim besides her. Lisan has a royal destiny to be fulfilled.
Kathrina Mohd Daud’s The Fisherman King is an epic novel, anchored in the folk traditions of Brunei. It shares fantastical tales and yesteryear stories which blend magic, fate, sacrifice and national history.
Lisan, adopted and raised in the Water Village, was informed early in life that he was of royal descent. The nanny who had told him passed away before he could ask her more questions. Lisan remains haunted by his parentage and past as he grows up. This loss never fades away even when he meets Bhatia, his soulmate, in secondary school (and whom he later marries). Love, and the bond between Lisan and Bhatia seems unbreakable. Yet, she is not able to make him renounce his obsession over investigating his family origins. One day he leaves her and everything behind. Their reunion after eight years is at first uneasy, bittersweet, with a new man now settled in Bhatia’s life.</a>

"Ladies and gentlemen, today I would like to discuss a topic that has been debated for centuries – beauty or intelligence. Both are highly sought after qualities in our society, but which one holds more value? Some people believe that beauty is the key to success in life, while others argue that intelligence is far more important. As we delve deeper into this topic, we will examine the pros and cons of each and hopefully come to a better understanding of what truly makes a person successful.
Let's start by exploring the concept of beauty. Beauty is often considered to be a gift from nature, a physical attribute that can be enhanced through makeup and cosmetic procedures. People who possess this gift often enjoy a range of benefits, such as being more attractive to potential partners, having an easier time finding employment, and even earning higher salaries. However, it's important to remember that beauty is subjective, and what one person finds attractive, another may not. Moreover, beauty is fleeting – it fades with time, leaving one to rely on other qualities.
On the other hand, intelligence is a quality that lasts a lifetime. Intelligent people possess the ability to think critically, solve complex problems, and learn from their mistakes. These skills are highly valued in the workplace, where the ability to think outside the box and come up with innovative solutions can make all the difference. Intelligence is also highly beneficial in our personal lives, as it allows us to make informed decisions and communicate effectively with others.
While both beauty and intelligence have their advantages, it's clear that intelligence is the more valuable quality in the long run. Beauty may open doors, but it's intelligence that keeps them open. A beautiful person may initially attract attention, but it's their intelligence that will earn them respect and admiration. Additionally, intelligence can be developed through education and experience, whereas beauty is largely predetermined.
In conclusion, the debate between beauty and intelligence has raged on for centuries, with no clear winner. However, when we examine the advantages of each, it becomes clear that intelligence is the more valuable quality. Beauty may be alluring, but it's intelligence that truly sets a person apart from the crowd. So let us all strive to cultivate our minds and develop our intelligence, as it is the key to true success and fulfillment in life. Thank you."</a>

                                            pls translate to Tagalog/Filipino.It's great that the economy is growing and rebounding back from the hit it took from the COVID-19 pandemic. It's not there yet, but I'm optimistic about the situation.The government's plan to keep up the rise and recover by acceleration of the vaccineprogram is one I'm certainly looking forward to. If this pace continues, we're certainly recover.Further on, oil prices going to be still high or not is certainly another thing to watch out for, which the chief of the Natural Economic and Development authority said the country will be doing. They're saying they have it if it does go up, as I have no idea what they're talking about I'm going to trust them. Moving forward, Both industry and service sectors growing is positive, but agriculture growth being impeded and even pushed back by typhoons and the African swine fever is a shame. The rise in gross domestic product (GDP) is primarily driven by household consumption accounting for 5.2 percentage of overall GDP growth is great, I guess I'll have to buy more or something to help the economy.My reaction really isn't much of a reaction, but I certainly hope I'll understand most of these terms by the end of the school year.​</a>

I hope you understand how much having you in my life means to me. You have made my problems lighter and my life better.

                            3. 1. “Mother tongue education refers to any form of schooling that makes use of the language or languages that children are most familiar with. This is usually the language that children speak at home with their family. The ‘mother tongue’ does not have to be the language spoken by the mother. Children can and often do speak more than one or even two languages at home.”
2. “Another way to grasp the concept of animatism is to differentiate the Cebuano terms gahum and kusog. Gahum comes closer to the Tagalog galing, acquired power or skill as in the case of politics, while kusog comes closer to the Tagalog lakas, an almost innate power with connotations of dynamism and energy.”

Myth 4: If X is happy in a particular field, I will be happy too 
Fact: You are not X
Everyone is different and what works for one person won’t necessarily work 
for another, even if that other person is someone with whom you have a lot in 
common. If someone you know has a career that interests you try and get more 
details about the career in terms of the job description, the skills required and market 
demand of the career. Then match the description with your traits and then make a 
choice. Be aware that what you like may not necessarily be a good fit for you</h2><br />
                        Ang tinutukoy ni "X" ay yung mga taong close mo(kaibigan, boyfriend/gilrfriend, at magulang). Ibig sabihin hinid porket masaya si X na nagtatrabaho sa specific job ay magiging masaya ka na rin pag yun ang pinili mong trabaho. Halimbawa: Masaya naman si mama sa pagiging teacher siguro magiging masaya narin ako.<br /><br />Syempre hindi yan totoo kasi may iba't iba tayong gustong ginagawa. Kung kukunin mo yung hindi mo gusto at gusto lang ng iba malaki ang posibilidad na hindi maging maganda nag resulta.<br />

                            7. Tagalog meaning of Friendships are ties formed by two or more people who want to interact with one other. It entails taking an interest in one another's thoughts, feelings, and experiences. Friendships are built on trust, respect, emotional support, and admiration. Life's too short to waste your days with someone who make you feel unworthy and unappreciated. Spend it with friends who makes you laugh and feel loved.
I hope you understand how much having you in my life means to me. You have made my problems lighter and my life better. You've been there when the weather was good and stood with me in the rain, you've laughed with me in the good times and the bad, and you've even shared my sorrow. I adore everything about you because you're more than just a friend to me; you're also my best friend and a bro.</h2><br />

Lisan, a humble fisherman, mysteriously disappears for eight years before returning home. Bhatia, the wife he has left behind, has remarried in the meantime, but there’s more, and something irrepressible for him to reclaim besides her. Lisan has a royal destiny to be fulfilled.
Kathrina Mohd Daud’s The Fisherman King is an epic novel, anchored in the folk traditions of Brunei. It shares fantastical tales and yesteryear stories which blend magic, fate, sacrifice and national history.
Lisan, adopted and raised in the Water Village, was informed early in life that he was of royal descent. The nanny who had told him passed away before he could ask her more questions. Lisan remains haunted by his parentage and past as he grows up. This loss never fades away even when he meets Bhatia, his soulmate, in secondary school (and whom he later marries). Love, and the bond between Lisan and Bhatia seems unbreakable. Yet, she is not able to make him renounce his obsession over investigating his family origins. One day he leaves her and everything behind. Their reunion after eight years is at first uneasy, bittersweet, with a new man now settled in Bhatia’s life.</h2><br />

"Ladies and gentlemen, today I would like to discuss a topic that has been debated for centuries – beauty or intelligence. Both are highly sought after qualities in our society, but which one holds more value? Some people believe that beauty is the key to success in life, while others argue that intelligence is far more important. As we delve deeper into this topic, we will examine the pros and cons of each and hopefully come to a better understanding of what truly makes a person successful.
Let's start by exploring the concept of beauty. Beauty is often considered to be a gift from nature, a physical attribute that can be enhanced through makeup and cosmetic procedures. People who possess this gift often enjoy a range of benefits, such as being more attractive to potential partners, having an easier time finding employment, and even earning higher salaries. However, it's important to remember that beauty is subjective, and what one person finds attractive, another may not. Moreover, beauty is fleeting – it fades with time, leaving one to rely on other qualities.
On the other hand, intelligence is a quality that lasts a lifetime. Intelligent people possess the ability to think critically, solve complex problems, and learn from their mistakes. These skills are highly valued in the workplace, where the ability to think outside the box and come up with innovative solutions can make all the difference. Intelligence is also highly beneficial in our personal lives, as it allows us to make informed decisions and communicate effectively with others.
While both beauty and intelligence have their advantages, it's clear that intelligence is the more valuable quality in the long run. Beauty may open doors, but it's intelligence that keeps them open. A beautiful person may initially attract attention, but it's their intelligence that will earn them respect and admiration. Additionally, intelligence can be developed through education and experience, whereas beauty is largely predetermined.
In conclusion, the debate between beauty and intelligence has raged on for centuries, with no clear winner. However, when we examine the advantages of each, it becomes clear that intelligence is the more valuable quality. Beauty may be alluring, but it's intelligence that truly sets a person apart from the crowd. So let us all strive to cultivate our minds and develop our intelligence, as it is the key to true success and fulfillment in life. Thank you."</h2><br />

Gayunpaman, mahalagang tandaan na ang kagandahan ay subjective, at kung ano ang nakikita ng isang tao na kaakit-akit, ang iba ay maaaring hindi.

Ang mga kasanayang ito ay lubos na pinahahalagahan sa lugar ng trabaho, kung saan ang kakayahang mag-isip sa labas ng kahon at makabuo ng mga makabagong solusyon ay maaaring gumawa ng lahat ng pagkakaiba.

Ang isang magandang tao sa una ay maaaring makaakit ng pansin, ngunit ang kanilang katalinuhan ang magbibigay sa kanila ng paggalang at paghanga.

Maaaring kaakit-akit ang kagandahan, ngunit ang katalinuhan ang tunay na nagtatakda ng isang tao bukod sa karamihan.

Ang isang magandang tao sa una ay maaaring makaakit ng pansin, ngunit ang kanilang katalinuhan ang magbibigay sa kanila ng paggalang at paghanga. Bukod pa rito, ang katalinuhan ay maaaring mabuo sa pamamagitan ng edukasyon at karanasan, samantalang ang kagandahan ay higit na natukoy.</p><p></p><p>Sa konklusyon, ang debate sa pagitan ng kagandahan at katalinuhan ay nagpatuloy sa loob ng maraming siglo, na walang malinaw na nagwagi. Gayunpaman, kapag sinusuri natin ang mga pakinabang ng bawat isa, nagiging malinaw na ang katalinuhan ay ang mas mahalagang kalidad. Maaaring kaakit-akit ang kagandahan, ngunit ang katalinuhan ang tunay na nagtatakda ng isang tao bukod sa karamihan. Kaya't pagsikapan nating lahat na linangin ang ating isipan at paunlarin ang ating katalinuhan, dahil ito ang susi sa tunay na tagumpay at katuparan sa buhay. Salamat."</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>trinanslate ko lang din po sa google translation:)</p><br />

                            13. pls translate to Tagalog/Filipino.It's great that the economy is growing and rebounding back from the hit it took from the COVID-19 pandemic. It's not there yet, but I'm optimistic about the situation.The government's plan to keep up the rise and recover by acceleration of the vaccineprogram is one I'm certainly looking forward to. If this pace continues, we're certainly recover.Further on, oil prices going to be still high or not is certainly another thing to watch out for, which the chief of the Natural Economic and Development authority said the country will be doing. They're saying they have it if it does go up, as I have no idea what they're talking about I'm going to trust them. Moving forward, Both industry and service sectors growing is positive, but agriculture growth being impeded and even pushed back by typhoons and the African swine fever is a shame. The rise in gross domestic product (GDP) is primarily driven by household consumption accounting for 5.2 percentage of overall GDP growth is great, I guess I'll have to buy more or something to help the economy.My reaction really isn't much of a reaction, but I certainly hope I'll understand most of these terms by the end of the school year.​</h2><br />

Sa pasulong, parehong positibo ang paglago ng industriya at mga sektor ng serbisyo, ngunit ang paglago ng agrikultura ay nahahadlangan at itinutulak pa ng mga bagyo at African swine fever ay isang kahihiyan. Ang pagtaas sa gross domestic product (GDP) ay pangunahing hinihimok ng pagkonsumo ng sambahayan na nagkakahalaga ng 5.2 porsyento ng kabuuang paglago ng GDP, sa palagay ko kailangan kong bumili ng higit pa o isang bagay upang makatulong sa ekonomiya.</p><p></p><p>Ang aking reaksyon ay talagang hindi gaanong reaksyon, ngunit tiyak na inaasahan kong mauunawaan ko ang karamihan sa mga terminong ito sa pagtatapos ng taon ng pag-aaral.</p><br />

                            14. Friendships are ties formed by two or more people who want to interact with one other. It entails taking an interest in one another's thoughts, feelings, and experiences. Friendships are built on trust, respect, emotional support, and admiration. Life's too short to waste your days with someone who make you feel unworthy and unappreciated. Spend it with friends who makes you laugh and feel loved.
I hope you understand how much having you in my life means to me. You have made my problems lighter and my life better. You've been there when the weather was tagalog meaning of good and stood with me in the rain, you've laughed with me in the good times and the bad, and you've even shared my sorrow. I adore everything about you because you're more than just a friend to me; you're also my best friend and a bro.</h2><br />

Myth 4: If X is happy in a particular field, I will be happy too 
Fact: You are not X
Everyone is different and what works for one person won’t necessarily work 
for another, even if that other person is someone with whom you have a lot in 
common. If someone you know has a career that interests you try and get more 
details about the career in terms of the job description, the skills required and market 
demand of the career. Then match the description with your traits and then make a 
choice. Be aware that what you like may not necessarily be a good fit for you</h2><br />
                        All of us is different on every way out even though we have resemblance it doesn`t mean that they are similar to each other. You should know the field that you are taking and it must fit in your traits or specifications for better outcomes.<br />
