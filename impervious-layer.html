                                            27-30. Give 4 benefits in planting trees or fruit-bearing trees​Social BenefitsTrees make life nicer. It has been shown that spending time among trees and green spaces reduces the amount of stress that we carry around with us in our daily lives.Hospital patients have been shown to recover from surgery more quickly when their hospital room offered a view of trees.Children have been shown to retain more of the information taught in schools if they spend some of their time outdoors in green spaces.Trees are often planted as living memorials or reminders of loved ones or to commemorate significant events in our lives.Communal BenefitsEven though you may own the trees on your property your neighbors may benefit from them as well.Through careful planning trees can be an asset to your entire community.Tree lined streets have a traffic calming effect, traffic moves more slowly and safely.Trees can be placed to screen unwanted views or noise from busy highways.Trees can complement the architecture or design of buildings or entire neighborhoods.Environmental BenefitsTrees offer many environmental benefits.Trees reduce the urban heat island effect through evaporative cooling and reducing the amount of sunlight that reaches parking lots and buildings. This is especially true in areas with large impervious surfaces, such as parking lots of stores and industrial complexes.Trees improve our air quality by filtering harmful dust and pollutants such as ozone, carbon monoxide, and sulfur dioxide from the air we breathe.Trees give off oxygen that we need to breathe.Trees reduce the amount of storm water runoff, which reduces erosion and pollution in our waterways and may reduce the effects of flooding.Many species of wildlife depend on trees for habitat. Trees provide food, protection, and homes for many birds and mammals.Economic BenefitsWell placed trees can reduce your cooling costs in the summer by shading the south and west sides of your home. If deciduous trees are used they will allow the sun to pass through and warm your home in the winter.Evergreen trees on the north side of your home and shrubs around the foundation of your home can act as a windbreak to reduce the cooling effects of winter winds.The value of a well landscaped home with mature healthy trees can be as much as 10% higher than a similar home with no or little landscaping. (Topping will reduce the value of your trees)Some indirect economic benefits of trees are that if we reduce the energy we use then utility companies will have less demand placed on the infrastructure, thus reducing operating costs which can be passed on to the consumer.</a>

You'll read two sources and consider the point of view of each author. How might the authors' perspectives influence their thinking on how to approach the Soviet Union
...Russian rulers have invariably sensed that their rule was relatively archaic in form, fragile and artificial in its psychological foundation, unable to stand comparison for contact with political systems of Western countries. For this reason, they have always feared foreign penetration, feared direct contact between [the] Western world and their own, feared what would happen if Russians learned [the] truth about [the] world without or if foreigners learned [the] truth about [the] world within. And they have learned to seek security only in patient but deadly struggle for total destruction of rival power, never in compacts and compromises with it.
Soviet power, unlike that of Hitlerite Germany, is neither schematic nor adventuristic. It does not work by fixed plans. It does not take unnecessary risks. Impervious to logic of reason, and it is highly sensitive to logic of force. For this reason, it can easily withdraw—and usually does—when strong resistance is encountered at any point. Thus, if the adversary has sufficient force and makes clear his readiness to use it, he rarely has to do so. If situations are properly handled, there need be no prestige-engaging showdowns. Gauged against [the] Western world as a whole, Soviets are still by far the weaker force. Thus, their success will really depend on degree of cohesion, firmness, and vigor which [the] Western world can muster. And this is [a] factor which it is within our power to influence.
(George Kennan, "The Long Telegram," 1946)
Now think about the contrasting points of view that were expressed in the two excerpts you've read. Use the annotations you've made in each excerpt to help you complete the table.
TIP: Remember, as you fill out each column, you're writing from the perspective of a hardliner or a diplomacy advocate, NOT as yourself. Write the answers you believe they would write them.

Meanwhile, as for the answers of the questions asked:</p><p></p><p>1. The correct answer would be <strong>impersonating</strong>, because the second phrase talks about <strong>"take off the President", meaning that the comedian acts like the President.</strong></p><p>2. The answer to this blank should be <strong>limited</strong>, because other words are used in different context.</p><p>3. Oblivious, because there is an adverb "<strong>completely</strong>", that indicates the <strong>highest impact of the adjective</strong>. <strong>Among the five choices, oblivious fits that criteria.</strong></p><p>4. The only word that goes with "<strong>out</strong>" in this sentence is <strong>robbed</strong>, hence the answer is robbed.</p><p>5. The answer is <strong>ensure </strong>because it means <strong>"to make sure of", "to increase the probability of something"</strong></p><p>6.

                            8. 27-30. Give 4 benefits in planting trees or fruit-bearing trees​Social BenefitsTrees make life nicer. It has been shown that spending time among trees and green spaces reduces the amount of stress that we carry around with us in our daily lives.Hospital patients have been shown to recover from surgery more quickly when their hospital room offered a view of trees.Children have been shown to retain more of the information taught in schools if they spend some of their time outdoors in green spaces.Trees are often planted as living memorials or reminders of loved ones or to commemorate significant events in our lives.Communal BenefitsEven though you may own the trees on your property your neighbors may benefit from them as well.Through careful planning trees can be an asset to your entire community.Tree lined streets have a traffic calming effect, traffic moves more slowly and safely.Trees can be placed to screen unwanted views or noise from busy highways.Trees can complement the architecture or design of buildings or entire neighborhoods.Environmental BenefitsTrees offer many environmental benefits.Trees reduce the urban heat island effect through evaporative cooling and reducing the amount of sunlight that reaches parking lots and buildings. This is especially true in areas with large impervious surfaces, such as parking lots of stores and industrial complexes.Trees improve our air quality by filtering harmful dust and pollutants such as ozone, carbon monoxide, and sulfur dioxide from the air we breathe.Trees give off oxygen that we need to breathe.Trees reduce the amount of storm water runoff, which reduces erosion and pollution in our waterways and may reduce the effects of flooding.Many species of wildlife depend on trees for habitat. Trees provide food, protection, and homes for many birds and mammals.Economic BenefitsWell placed trees can reduce your cooling costs in the summer by shading the south and west sides of your home. If deciduous trees are used they will allow the sun to pass through and warm your home in the winter.Evergreen trees on the north side of your home and shrubs around the foundation of your home can act as a windbreak to reduce the cooling effects of winter winds.The value of a well landscaped home with mature healthy trees can be as much as 10% higher than a similar home with no or little landscaping. (Topping will reduce the value of your trees)Some indirect economic benefits of trees are that if we reduce the energy we use then utility companies will have less demand placed on the infrastructure, thus reducing operating costs which can be passed on to the consumer.</h2><br />

                            10. In this task, you'll consider the Cold War from the perspective of a hardliner and the perspective of a diplomacy advocate. You'll read two sources and consider the point of view of each author. How might the authors' perspectives influence their thinking on how to approach the Soviet Union
...Russian rulers have invariably sensed that their rule was relatively archaic in form, fragile and artificial in its psychological foundation, unable to stand comparison for contact with political systems of Western countries. For this reason, they have always feared foreign penetration, feared direct contact between [the] Western world and their own, feared what would happen if Russians learned [the] truth about [the] world without or if foreigners learned [the] truth about [the] world within. And they have learned to seek security only in patient but deadly struggle for total destruction of rival power, never in compacts and compromises with it.
Soviet power, unlike that of Hitlerite Germany, is neither schematic nor adventuristic. It does not work by fixed plans. It does not take unnecessary risks. Impervious to logic of reason, and it is highly sensitive to logic of force. For this reason, it can easily withdraw—and usually does—when strong resistance is encountered at any point. Thus, if the adversary has sufficient force and makes clear his readiness to use it, he rarely has to do so. If situations are properly handled, there need be no prestige-engaging showdowns. Gauged against [the] Western world as a whole, Soviets are still by far the weaker force. Thus, their success will really depend on degree of cohesion, firmness, and vigor which [the] Western world can muster. And this is [a] factor which it is within our power to influence.
(George Kennan, "The Long Telegram," 1946)
Now think about the contrasting points of view that were expressed in the two excerpts you've read. Use the annotations you've made in each excerpt to help you complete the table.
